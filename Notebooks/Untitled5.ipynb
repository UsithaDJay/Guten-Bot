Mary Lee, less excitable, was, nevertheless,\\r\\n\\n\\nnervously putting in and taking out various articles from a leather\\r\\n\\n\\nsatchel. Jean was trying to sop up some ink her twin sister, Jack, had\\r\\n\\n\\nspilt on the floor and over her precious self. \"I was just going to\\r\\n\\n\\nwrite a card so as it would be all ready to put on Aunt Helen\\'s trunk,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nwailed Jack, \"and the ink bottle slipped before I could catch it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind, never mind,\" comforted Jean. \"It\\'s coming out a little\\r\\n\\n\\nbit, Jack, and there\\'s plenty of time.

              " Document(page_content='bit, Jack, and there\\'s plenty of time. Unc\\' Landy has something that\\r\\n\\n\\nwill take it out real crick. Now, do be criet and I\\'ll go ask him for\\r\\n\\n\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSomewhat pacified, Jack\\'s sobs ceased, though she sat mournfully\\r\\n\\n\\ncontemplating the spot on the floor. Fortunately the carpet was old,\\r\\n\\n\\npatched and darned in places, so the damage done was less remarked than\\r\\n\\n\\nif it had been a new one. There had been other overturnings of ink,\\r\\n\\n\\nof water, of various other things, in days gone by, so its color was\\r\\n\\n\\ndingy and uncertain. Jack turned her gaze from the carpet to her own\\r\\n\\n\\nstained fingers saturated to the tips with the inky fluid. \"They\\'ll\\r\\n\\n\\nlook dreadful to travel with,\" she said ruefully as Jean returned, \"and\\r\\n\\n\\nAunt Helen says ladies never have black fingernails.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, well, we aren\\'t ladies yet,\" returned Jean consolingly. \"Of course\\r\\n\\n\\nwe\\'ll not have when we are ladies, because we\\'ll have time then to sit\\r\\n\\n\\nand use all those little things Aunt Helen has: files and scissors and\\r\\n\\n\\nthings. Here\\'s the stuff, Jack. Unc\\' Landy says this is hosally-assy,\\r\\n\\n\\nand it is very strong; you have to use only a few grains of it in some\\r\\n\\n\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder what it\\'s made of,\" remarked Jack, as Jean carefully poured a\\r\\n\\n\\nfew crystals into her hand from the small vial she held.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I asked him,\" returned Jean, \"and he said he reckoned it was made of\\r\\n\\n\\nhorses and mules, like glue. He said the Bible calls mules asses; you\\r\\n\\n\\nremember Balaam\\'s ass that spoke. Unc\\' Landy said he didn\\'t know what\\r\\n\\n\\nthe ally meant, but there was the hoss and the ass. He said they make\\r\\n\\n\\nlots of things out of animals. Rennet is made from the stomachs of\\r\\n\\n\\ncalves, and then there\\'s ox-gall, he said, for setting colors.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s right knowing for an old darky,\" returned Jack, wetting her\\r\\n\\n\\nfinger and carefully touching a crystal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the way to do it,\" said Jean hastily. \"You must put it in\\r\\n\\n\\nwater.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why this way isn\\'t just as good,\" returned Jack. \"It is\\r\\n\\n\\ncoming out, Jean. See, that little spot is nearly clean.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It would be just as well to do it the right way,\" persisted Jean. She\\r\\n\\n\\nwent over to the washstand, procured a mug half full of water into\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich she poured some grains of the oxalic acid, and brought it to Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nwho plunged her fingers in it and sat comfortably soaking them while\\r\\n\\n\\nJean attended to the carpet.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were absorbed in this occupation when Mary Lee came in. \"What are\\r\\n\\n\\nyou two doing?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Jack spilled some ink and we are getting it all out,\" replied\\r\\n\\n\\nJean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I should think you were,\" said Mary Lee, viewing the basin of\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscolored water. \"What is the matter with your hands, Jack? Have you\\r\\n\\n\\nburned them?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, I am soaking off the ink with hossally-assy that Unc\\' Landy gave\\r\\n\\n\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Not hossally, goosey; it\\'s oxalic.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, then it\\'s oxes and mules, Jean,\" she said in an undertone to her\\r\\n\\n\\ntwin sister.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is a good thing mother made you wear that old frock till the very\\r\\n\\n\\nlast minute,\" remarked Mary Lee, opening a closet door and running her\\r\\n\\n\\neye over the contents. \"I believe we have left nothing here that we\\r\\n\\n\\nshall want. You children had better hurry up; Nan wants us to form a\\r\\n\\n\\nprocession to make the good-byes. We\\'re going right away.\" She came and\\r\\n\\n\\nstood near her little sisters. \"I don\\'t believe you can get any more\\r\\n\\n\\nout, Jean; it\\'s an old faded carpet, anyhow, and very likely we shall\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a new one when we get back. I wouldn\\'t bother over it. Come on\\r\\n\\n\\ndown. Time is flying and we must say the good-byes.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThus admonished the twins arose from the floor, Jack carefully\\r\\n\\n\\nexamining her fingers. \"They\\'re not crite so bad,\" said Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think they\\'re much better,\" declared Jack with conviction. \"When\\r\\n\\n\\nthey\\'re dry they will do very well.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I promised Unc\\' Landy that I would take the bottle right back to him,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nJean said.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='they\\'re dry they will do very well.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I promised Unc\\' Landy that I would take the bottle right back to him,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nJean said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And tell him it is oxes, not horses,\" said Jack emptying the contents\\r\\n\\n\\nof the mug. \"Wait a minute and I\\'ll go with you, Jean. We shall have\\r\\n\\n\\nto go to the stable to say good-bye to Pete and the cow and chickens.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s Nan calling now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey ran down to find their two elder sisters waiting for them. \"Come\\r\\n\\n\\non,\" said Nan. \"We shall have to dress pretty soon, and there is no\\r\\n\\n\\ntime to lose. We are going to the stable first and the gardens last.\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee has some food for the chickens and I have an apple for Pete.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey started out, Nan leading the procession. At the stable they found\\r\\n\\n\\nUnc\\' Landy looking glum and unresponsive. It was a sore day for him\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich saw his \"fambly\" depart for California.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head as the children went through the ceremony of making\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir adieux to the old mule, Pete. \"Lak as not yuh-all\\'s don\\' see dat\\r\\n\\n\\nol\\' mewl agin,\" he remarked, \"an\\' mebbe I git called to glory mahse\\'f\\r\\n\\n\\nfo\\' yuh gits back, yuh gwine stay so long.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, aren\\'t you well, Unc\\' Landy?\" chorused the four girls.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I got tur\\'ble mis\\'ry in mah back,\" he said, \"an\\' I only tollable these\\r\\n\\n\\ndays. Lak as not I don\\' las\\' th\\'ough de wintah.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was distressing, but the practical Mary Lee remembered that Unc\\'\\r\\n\\n\\nLandy prophesied this calamity at the beginning of each season. In\\r\\n\\n\\nthe spring it was a \"mis\\'ry in de haid\" which would prevent his living\\r\\n\\n\\ntill autumn. In the summer he was \"so plumb wo\\' out\" he didn\\'t expect\\r\\n\\n\\nto see another Christmas. In the winter he was \"dat oneasy in de jints\"\\r\\n\\n\\nhe wasn\\'t to be expected to leave his bed again by spring. Yet the\\r\\n\\n\\nprophecies never came true, Mary Lee reflected, so she said cheerfully:\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It would be a real low-down trick, Unc\\' Landy, for you not to wait\\r\\n\\n\\ntill we get back. I don\\'t believe you could do us so mean as not to\\r\\n\\n\\nhave us here to see to your funeral.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt which speech Unc\\' Landy chuckled and wagged his head, and when they\\r\\n\\n\\ntook up the line of march after having parted from their stable pets\\r\\n\\n\\nhe followed in their wake. Before long four others had fallen into\\r\\n\\n\\nline. The first of them was Phil Lewis, then came the Gordon boys,\\r\\n\\n\\nAshby and Randolph, and lastly came Trouble, the old mongrel dog who\\r\\n\\n\\nhad shared many an experience of the Corner family\\'s. As for Phil, he\\r\\n\\n\\nwas a \"double cousin\" because he was related to both the Lees and the\\r\\n\\n\\nCorners. The Gordon boys were cousins, too, though less nearly related.\\r\\n\\n\\nThey were going to school in the town and were boarding at the Corners\\'\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse which was now overlooked by Aunt Sarah Dent.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We don\\'t mean to echo your good-byes,\" said Randolph, as he came up,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"but we want your company when you are going to leave us so soon.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee turned to Phil. \"You will have an eye to poor old Trouble,\\r\\n\\n\\nwon\\'t you?\" she said. \"Doctor him up if anything happens to him. Then\\r\\n\\n\\nthe chickens and the ducks and all, I depend on you, Phil, not to let\\r\\n\\n\\nanything happen to them.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Gracious!\" exclaimed Nan. \"You certainly are giving Phil a weight of\\r\\n\\n\\nresponsibility. As if he could run after the chickens and ducks all\\r\\n\\n\\nday.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, he knows I don\\'t expect him to do that, but that I hope he will\\r\\n\\n\\ntake a general supervision of them.\" Phil promised to do his best and\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee knew he would not fail her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack slipped her hand into Randolph\\'s. He was a tall, fine looking boy\\r\\n\\n\\nwho towered up above the little lass, but who was quite chummy with\\r\\n\\n\\nher. \"Won\\'t you sometimes let Baz in when he is shut out in the cold?\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe whispered. Baz was her cat of whom she was very fond. \"Everybody\\r\\n\\n\\npays attention to Lady Grey,\" she went on, \"but Baz will get neglected\\r\\n\\n\\nif I am not here.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nRan smiled down at her. \"Shall I get a bell for his neck so I can tell\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen he is around?\"', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

Ever since she nursed me last year we have been.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Ran, \"if she is good enough to come here to keep house\\r\\n\\n\\nand look after the comfort of us boys, I reckon the least we can do is\\r\\n\\n\\nto make her as little trouble as possible and to think of her comfort\\r\\n\\n\\nsometimes.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Spoken like a true Southern gentleman,\" returned Nan laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFrom stable to hen-house; from hen-house to garden; from garden to\\r\\n\\n\\norchard they had taken their way. Many were the charges Unc\\' Landy\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived concerning this hen, that duck; this crop of vegetables, that\\r\\n\\n\\nyield of fruit, and now the final spot was reached and they returned\\r\\n\\n\\nsolemnly to the house, a little cast down as they considered how long\\r\\n\\n\\nit would be before they saw each familiar place again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLeaving the three boys to pass away the time as they should choose\\r\\n\\n\\ntill the moment came when they were to escort them to the railway\\r\\n\\n\\nstation, the three younger girls hurried up-stairs to make ready for\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir journey. Nan, however, lingered below for a few moments. She had\\r\\n\\n\\none more farewell to make. She slipped into the deserted living-room,\\r\\n\\n\\nand going to her piano, her last year\\'s Christmas gift from her\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandmother, she opened it, passed her hand lovingly along the keys,\\r\\n\\n\\nand laid her cheek against the shining case. \"Good-bye, you precious\\r\\n\\n\\nthing,\" she whispered. \"I wish I could take you with me, but I will\\r\\n\\n\\ncome back to you, and there is one good thing about it; you will be\\r\\n\\n\\nexactly the same, no taller, as the boys will be; you will not get\\r\\n\\n\\nrheumatism in your joints, as Unc\\' Landy may do, and you will seem\\r\\n\\n\\nas young as ever when I come back.\" After a last loving pat upon the\\r\\n\\n\\nclosed lid, she locked the piano and carried the key to Aunt Sarah for\\r\\n\\n\\nsafe keeping. Then she went up-stairs to join the others in making\\r\\n\\n\\nready for their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee\\'s bag was neatly packed and Jean had followed her example by\\r\\n\\n\\nstowing away her belongings in an orderly manner, but Jack was pulling\\r\\n\\n\\nopen bureau drawers and ransacking every corner for the gloves and\\r\\n\\n\\nhandkerchief which she declared she had carefully laid away. \"Do help\\r\\n\\n\\nme, Nan,\" she implored; \"the others are so mean and say I am careless\\r\\n\\n\\nand that they will go off without me if I don\\'t hurry. You won\\'t let\\r\\n\\n\\nthem leave me behind, will you, Nan?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed I will not,\" said Nan heartily. \"Don\\'t fly about so crazily.\\r\\n\\n\\nSit down for a second and try to think where you last saw the things.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat were you doing after you had them?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack plumped herself down on the floor and folded her hands. \"I--let\\r\\n\\n\\nme see,--oh, yes, I went down-stairs to see if there were any more\\r\\n\\n\\ncaramels.

Coming, mother,\" and\\r\\n\\n\\npushing Jack ahead of her she gave one swift glance around the room and\\r\\n\\n\\njoined the group standing on the porch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe carriage was already waiting at the door. Mary Lee and Jean were\\r\\n\\n\\nseated complacently therein. It was a big, roomy old hack such as the\\r\\n\\n\\nlivery stable of the town afforded for the use of the traveling public,\\r\\n\\n\\nand there was space enough for the six of them to be comfortably seated\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout crowding. Mary Lee leaned back sedately, but Jack and Nan\\r\\n\\n\\nstretched their necks out of the window till the corner was turned,\\r\\n\\n\\ndespite the criticism which this performance brought from Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You look like country jakes,\" she declared, \"as if you had never\\r\\n\\n\\ntraveled before. Do take in your heads; people will laugh at you.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care if they do,\" responded Nan. \"It won\\'t be the first time\\r\\n\\n\\nwe have been laughed at, will it, Jack?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And it won\\'t be the last, if you are going to keep up this sort of\\r\\n\\n\\ndoings,\" returned Mary Lee with a superior air.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t let\\'s fuss just as we are starting out,\" put in Jean\\r\\n\\n\\nplaintively; \"it takes away all the good taste.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well spoken,\" said Miss Helen. \"Do be amiable, you others, and let us\\r\\n\\n\\ngo forth with a good taste in our mouths, as Jean says.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn consequence all four smiled sweetly as if to assure one another of\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir kindly feelings, and even when Nan called to Jack, \"Last look,\\r\\n\\n\\nhoney,\" Mary Lee said no word though Jack reached far out to catch a\\r\\n\\n\\nfinal glimpse of the brown house in its frame of red and yellow autumn\\r\\n\\n\\nleaves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis last view gave Aunt Sarah on the porch and Unc\\' Landy leaning\\r\\n\\n\\non the gate, Trouble at his side looking up wistfully, one ear\\r\\n\\n\\nflopping dejectedly over his eye; it was clear that he understood that\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething unusual must be the matter when the entire family went off\\r\\n\\n\\nin this stately manner. Their last view of the station showed three\\r\\n\\n\\nlads standing a-row, little Phil craning his neck to look after the\\r\\n\\n\\ndeparting train, tall Ran waving his hat and Ashby, between the two,\\r\\n\\n\\nshouting something which they did not hear.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now, we\\'re really off,\" said Nan with a sigh of satisfaction. \"I have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen dreadfully afraid that something would happen to prevent our\\r\\n\\n\\ntrip, for it seemed such a tremendously splendid thing for all of us\\r\\n\\n\\nto do.

So many changes in one\\r\\n\\n\\nshort year. Within that time she had met an unknown grandmother and had\\r\\n\\n\\nencountered her Aunt Helen only a year back, had made her acquaintance\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout knowing who she was, and had loved her at first sight. Thus had\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed the renewal of relations between the old brown house where the\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner girls lived and the big house of Uplands to which the elder Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner and her daughter had returned after several years\\' residence\\r\\n\\n\\nabroad. What a long winter it would have been, Nan reflected, if, while\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir precious mother was away in the Adirondacks for her health, there\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been no Aunt Helen near by. How like a true fairy godmother she had\\r\\n\\n\\ncome to them full of gifts which meant so much to a poverty-stricken\\r\\n\\n\\nhousehold. Now Uplands was in ashes and the old brown house, fresh\\r\\n\\n\\nwith new paint, was home to all of them except the grandmother whose\\r\\n\\n\\ntroubled spirit had left a feeble body the spring before. After long\\r\\n\\n\\nestrangement the sister and wife of John Corner were again dear\\r\\n\\n\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan looked across at them, at little Aunt Helen\\'s white hair and sweet\\r\\n\\n\\neyes, at her mother\\'s pale, gentle, lovely face. With a swift movement\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich she could not resist, Nan rushed across the aisle and bestowed a\\r\\n\\n\\nkiss upon each.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHer mother smiling, turned to Miss Helen. \"How like Nan,\" she said. \"I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan fancy just what made her do that.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen nodded. \"So can I.\" And her gaze fell upon Nan\\'s dark head\\r\\n\\n\\nturned now toward the car window.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was growing dark, and the landscape dimmed into large forms of\\r\\n\\n\\npurple mountains and russet plains, softly outlined in the October\\r\\n\\n\\nevening light. \"Speeding away, speeding away into a new world,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered Nan as the train rushed along.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut she was aroused from her dreams by Mary Lee\\'s drawling voice in her\\r\\n\\n\\near. \"Aunt Helen\\'s called you three times, you old drowsy owl.

In\\r\\n\\n\\nconsequence of this fancy she was led into a predicament which gave\\r\\n\\n\\nconsiderable trouble to the entire party.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen was conducting the expedition to California, for she was an\\r\\n\\n\\nexperienced traveler, but she confessed that Jack was an element such\\r\\n\\n\\nas she never before had been obliged to consider. The trunks had gone\\r\\n\\n\\non to the station, the carriage was waiting at the door, the bill had\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen paid, the servants had received their tips, but no Jack appeared.\\r\\n\\n\\nNan scurried in one direction, Mary Lee in another, Jean in a third.\\r\\n\\n\\nHad any one seen a little girl in brown hat and coat, wandering about\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hotel?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She was all ready to go, for I put on her hat myself,\" said Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner. \"What can have become of the child?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen started off to add her powers of search to the others. \"We\\r\\n\\n\\nhaven\\'t a great deal of time,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Dear, dear, what could have made the child do so?\" exclaimed Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner, annoyed by the delay.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn a few minutes Jean came running in. \"She\\'s in the elevator,\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid, \"and it\\'s stuck between the fourth and fifth floors, so she can\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\ngo up or down.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen Nan came along followed by Mary Lee. \"We\\'ve found out where she\\r\\n\\n\\nis, but we can\\'t get at her. What shall we do?\" they asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know,\" said Mrs. Corner. \"Go find your Aunt Helen,\\r\\n\\n\\nNan, and tell her what is the matter. We shall have to wait till\\r\\n\\n\\nanother train, I am afraid, though it will upset all our arrangements.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was no help for it; wait they must, for it required some\\r\\n\\n\\ntinkering to free the elevator and its occupants. \"Well, I hope you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave had enough of elevators,\" said Mary Lee, as she, with her sisters,\\r\\n\\n\\ngreeted the liberated Jack. \"You\\'ve made Aunt Helen, and all of us, a\\r\\n\\n\\nlot of trouble, for it is too late for our train and we shall have to\\r\\n\\n\\nwait till afternoon.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTo which Jack replied smoothly: \"Good! then I can go up and down ever\\r\\n\\n\\nso many times more.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed, you will do nothing of the kind,\" returned Nan. \"You will\\r\\n\\n\\nnot get out of our sight again, for who knows but the next time you\\r\\n\\n\\nmay have to stay all night between floors.

We must\\r\\n\\n\\nhurry or we won\\'t get back for the next train and that would be a sad\\r\\n\\n\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t care,\" remarked Jack nonchalantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To tell you the truth, neither should I,\" returned Nan, \"for I am\\r\\n\\n\\nquite willing to see more of this nice old place, but we can\\'t do just\\r\\n\\n\\nas we would like; we must think of mother and Aunt Helen. Don\\'t stop to\\r\\n\\n\\nlook at those postal cards, we can do that some other time.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo forth they fared into the streets of the old part of the city\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere in a certain shop the delectable sweets could be had in their\\r\\n\\n\\nperfection. It was in this same shop that they met the old gentleman.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe encounter came about in this wise. Jack dropped a penny on the\\r\\n\\n\\nfloor, and after groping for it under the counter, she came up in a\\r\\n\\n\\ndark corner and her head met the rotund middle of an old gentleman\\r\\n\\n\\nstanding there. \"Good gracious!\" he exclaimed, fairly jumping in\\r\\n\\n\\nsurprise as Jack crawled out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I hope I didn\\'t hurt you,\" said Jack apologetically.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen the old gentleman began to laugh, and said Jack afterward, \"He was\\r\\n\\n\\njust like Santa Claus, for he shook like a bowlful of jelly. If I had\\r\\n\\n\\nknown how far from his feet he stuck out in front I would have come out\\r\\n\\n\\nfurther along.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe laugh showed that he was not hurt, and Jack was so relieved that\\r\\n\\n\\nshe laughed too. \"Thought you\\'d knocked the breath out of me,\" said the\\r\\n\\n\\nold gentleman. \"Well, I find I can breathe yet, though I wonder what\\r\\n\\n\\nmade you come butting into me in that way. Are you a goat?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Jack; \"I\\'m only a kid.\"', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

He\\r\\n\\n\\nis so jolly and has such a pleasant face. You and Aunt Helen will like\\r\\n\\n\\nhim, I know. It was an awfully nice way to pass away the time; going\\r\\n\\n\\nfor pralines, I mean, not butting over old gentlemen. We saw some more\\r\\n\\n\\nqueer streets and Mr. Pinckney pointed out several interesting places\\r\\n\\n\\nto us. Are the pralines good, Aunt Helen?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"They are delicious.

He settled Jack in a seat by his side and evidently looked\\r\\n\\n\\nforward to being furnished with entertainment by that young person,\\r\\n\\n\\nand, indeed, Jack was quite equal to what was expected of her, though\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney did his share in making himself agreeable to her, and the\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo chattered away like old friends. What Mr. Pinckney did not learn\\r\\n\\n\\nabout the Corner family that day he did before the journey was ended.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We used to be as poor as church mice,\" Jack informed him\\r\\n\\n\\nconfidentially. \"That was before grandmother died. She quarreled with\\r\\n\\n\\nmy father and when he died she marched off to Europe and took all her\\r\\n\\n\\nmoney with her so mother couldn\\'t find a bit of it. Aunt Helen came\\r\\n\\n\\nback first and saw Nan and Nan made friends with her, though Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nSarah--you don\\'t know Aunt Sarah Dent, she\\'s mother\\'s aunt and she\\r\\n\\n\\ncouldn\\'t bear Grandma Corner. Well, she just made an awful fuss and\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn\\'t let Nan go over to Uplands at all. Nan snuck off, though, and\\r\\n\\n\\nAunt Sarah was as mad as hops.

This is a brand new\\r\\n\\n\\ncoat and so is the hat. Don\\'t you think they are pretty?

Jean always calls us trins; she can\\'t say\\r\\n\\n\\ntwins, nor twice, nor queen, nor any such words. She gets her tongue\\r\\n\\n\\ntwisted over them, she says. We are going to dress just alike till we\\r\\n\\n\\nare in our teens, and then mother says we are not to, for she doesn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nlike to see big girls dress the same.

Then hastily\\r\\n\\n\\nchanging the subject she said, \"Nan\\'s awfully smart. She can do all\\r\\n\\n\\nsorts of things. You ought just to hear her play on the piano and see\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat she can contrive out of nothing. I just love Nan.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And don\\'t you love the others?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Of course. Jean is my twin and I am bound to love her, but Mary Lee\\r\\n\\n\\nalways pushes me on to scrapes somehow and Nan gets me out of them.

They learned to sew and to spin and weave, that is the women\\r\\n\\n\\ndid, and the men were taught to be carpenters and farmers and builders.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Were they very wicked?\" asked Jack. \"They were Indians, I thought,\\r\\n\\n\\nand of course they used to scalp people and tomahawk them and dash\\r\\n\\n\\nthe babies against the trees to kill them; that is as bad, Jean, as\\r\\n\\n\\nthrowing them into the river.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s worse,\" declared Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, these were nice, kind Indians,\" said Nan comfortably; \"I don\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nsuppose they ever did those horrid things, did they, Aunt Helen?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"They were gentler than most, I believe, and they responded very\\r\\n\\n\\nlovingly to the teachings of the priests. There is nothing in\\r\\n\\n\\nCalifornia more interesting, to my mind, than those old churches\\r\\n\\n\\nfounded by the Spanish padres. Most of them are in ruins and the\\r\\n\\n\\nIndians, who labored so faithfully, were scattered far and wide.\\r\\n\\n\\nTheir descendants have now so degenerated that there are very few to\\r\\n\\n\\nrepresent the industrious, gentle people watched over so carefully\\r\\n\\n\\nby Father Junipero and his followers. I must send and get a copy of\\r\\n\\n\\n\\'Ramona,\\' for you older girls; we can read it aloud evenings, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nam sure you will soon be taking a very deep interest in these old\\r\\n\\n\\nmissions.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How many are there?\" asked Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"About twenty, but some of them are rather inaccessible and others are\\r\\n\\n\\nquite in a dilapidated condition so we will not visit all. We shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbegin with San Diego, for here we are within six miles of the site,\\r\\n\\n\\nthen we can go on to San Luis Rey and San Juan Capistrano on our way to\\r\\n\\n\\nLos Angeles, and then we can decide where we shall want to stay for the\\r\\n\\n\\nwinter.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s awfully nice here,\" remarked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but there might be a still nicer place,\" said Jean sagely,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"and then we\\'d be sorry when we came to it that we hadn\\'t looked\\r\\n\\n\\nfurther. You know we have said all along that we wanted to be near Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney,\" she reminded Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, that is so; we do want to do that, for then we may get boxes\\r\\n\\n\\nof candy every little while,\" returned Jack cheerfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s not the reason,\" said Nan severely. \"It is because he is so\\r\\n\\n\\nnice and will make us all at home. Won\\'t it seem queer to really settle\\r\\n\\n\\ndown to live in a perfectly strange place? I wonder how in the world we\\r\\n\\n\\nshall know what to buy and what to pay for it. How shall you manage,\\r\\n\\n\\nmother?\" She turned to Mrs. Corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I shall not bother my head over that problem till I face it,\" her\\r\\n\\n\\nmother made reply. \"I should judge from our experiences so far that we\\r\\n\\n\\nshall not want for what we need.

The six mile\\r\\n\\n\\ndrive to the spot was a pleasant one, for though November winds were\\r\\n\\n\\nwailing through the Virginia woods scattering the brown leaves over the\\r\\n\\n\\nground, here the sun was shining warm, and the first rain of a week\\r\\n\\n\\nearlier had given place to bright pleasant weather.

I\\'m glad of\\r\\n\\n\\nthat, but I want to hide my face under the bed-covers when I think of\\r\\n\\n\\nhow outrageously we have treated the Indians.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You certainly have the situation in a nut-shell,\" said Miss Helen with\\r\\n\\n\\na smile as they left the carriage and made their way to the mission\\r\\n\\n\\nto gain a view of the interior of the church, to look at the fine old\\r\\n\\n\\nmortuary chapel, the ancient pulpit and the pathetic ruins, now the\\r\\n\\n\\nabode of toads and lizards, and where weeds ran riot.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAmong the ruins they sat down with the padre who met them and who told\\r\\n\\n\\nthem tales of the past. He opened his heart on the matter of his hopes\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the future, his dear desire to see the mission fully restored, and,\\r\\n\\n\\nas they thought of its past, both Miss Helen and Nan echoed his wish.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s been like walking on my great-grandmother\\'s shoes,\" said Nan as\\r\\n\\n\\nthey drove away. \"I feel as if I had been living in her time or even in\\r\\n\\n\\nmy great-great\\'s. I feel sort of blinky and queer in my mind, as you do\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen you come out of a dark place into the sunlight.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen laughed. Nan\\'s original similes always amused her. \"How\\r\\n\\n\\nI shall love to take you to Europe,\" she said. \"You are such a\\r\\n\\n\\nsatisfactory sort of somebody, Nan.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Am I? That\\'s awfully complimentary, Aunt Helen.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, as a little boy I knew would say when you charged him with\\r\\n\\n\\nflattering you, \\'that isn\\'t a compliment, it\\'s the truth.\\' One would\\r\\n\\n\\nsuppose that a compliment couldn\\'t be the truth from his point of view,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut it can be and is, in this case.

Mr. Pinckney had descended\\r\\n\\n\\nupon them that morning early, and nothing would do but he must bear\\r\\n\\n\\nthe four away with him. \"Jennie has set her heart on their coming to\\r\\n\\n\\nspend the day,\" he told Mrs. Corner, and so they were permitted to go,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough their mother protested that it was an imposition to inflict Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nRoberts with the four at once.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do, Mary Lee,\" she gave this last charge, \"do look after Jack, and\\r\\n\\n\\nsee that she doesn\\'t get into any dreadful mischief.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee gave an affirmative nod of the head. \"I\\'ll look after her,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe promised. As a rule Mary Lee and Jean could be relied upon to\\r\\n\\n\\nreturn home from an expedition in about as good trim as when they\\r\\n\\n\\nstarted out, but Jack never did, and even Nan met with more frequent\\r\\n\\n\\nmishaps than her more orderly sisters.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUp the hill steeps the little party had driven to arrive at last\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore the door of Mrs. Roberts\\' pretty home. Roses clambered over the\\r\\n\\n\\nveranda vying with fuchsias and heliotrope in their efforts to climb to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe very roof of the house. Scarlet geraniums set off the pure white\\r\\n\\n\\nof calla lilies both forming a thick hedge in front of the garden.\\r\\n\\n\\nFlowers, flowers everywhere. \"The trouble here is not to coax them to\\r\\n\\n\\ngrow,\" said Mr. Pinckney, \"but to keep them from over-running the whole\\r\\n\\n\\nplace.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And how do you like California?\" was Mrs. Roberts\\' first question\\r\\n\\n\\nafter she had welcomed the girls.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We like it very strongly,\" replied Jack politely, who was foremost of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe group.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Roberts smiled at the odd expression, and disposed the girls\\r\\n\\n\\nabout the veranda. Jack in some way felt that she must answer for the\\r\\n\\n\\nrest, since Mr. Pinckney was her special acquaintance, and so she\\r\\n\\n\\nestablished herself nearest to Mrs. Roberts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t any little girls, have you?\" she asked by way of beginning\\r\\n\\n\\na chat.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" replied her hostess, \"I am not as fortunate as your mother who\\r\\n\\n\\nhas four.

They had not heard the\\r\\n\\n\\nconversation between Mrs. Roberts and Jack and were surprised when the\\r\\n\\n\\nlatter climbed upon Mr. Pinckney\\'s knee and said: \"Tell me about your\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle boy.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAn expression came over Mr. Pinckney\\'s face such as Jack had never seen\\r\\n\\n\\nthere before, as he put her down abruptly and walked off without a\\r\\n\\n\\nword.

You never saw\\r\\n\\n\\na dearer little lad, but after he grew up he was a little headstrong.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe was bent upon traveling and seeing the world; he had always longed\\r\\n\\n\\nto visit California and he came out here where he met a Mexican girl\\r\\n\\n\\nwhom he married without consulting his family. I suppose he thought\\r\\n\\n\\nthere would be objections raised and that he would run no risks of\\r\\n\\n\\nbeing separated from the girl.

We found my son\\'s grave,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut his wife had disappeared. We knew only her first name, for I would\\r\\n\\n\\nexpress no interest in her and made no inquiries of my son. She was a\\r\\n\\n\\nMexican, I said, and that was all I wanted to know. I do not know to\\r\\n\\n\\nthis day where they were married or where he met her. His last letter\\r\\n\\n\\nwas from San Diego, but there could be found no clue to him there. So\\r\\n\\n\\nyou see, little Jack, that perhaps, after all I would not make a very\\r\\n\\n\\ngood grandfather when I made so poor a father.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but you would, I know you would,\" said Jack comfortingly. \"Even\\r\\n\\n\\nmy mother is very cross with me sometimes, but she gets over it and is\\r\\n\\n\\nlovely afterward.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney smiled down at her and stroked her hair softly as he\\r\\n\\n\\nwent on. \"My daughter met Mr. Roberts out here, and married, so that\\r\\n\\n\\nbrings me to California every little while, and I am still searching.\\r\\n\\n\\nThere now, that is the whole story; we won\\'t speak of it again,\" and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe girls all understood that from henceforth they were to avoid the\\r\\n\\n\\nsubject.

The\\r\\n\\n\\nCalifornia of other days appealed strongly to her imagination and she\\r\\n\\n\\nasked a thousand questions about Ramona\\'s home, about the Indians, the\\r\\n\\n\\nMexicans and such things as suggested romance and poetry. The twins\\r\\n\\n\\napplied their thoughts to anything that came handy and spent most of\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir time watching a pet paisano, or chaparral cock, which Mr. Roberts\\r\\n\\n\\nhad tamed. They were much diverted, too, by the Chinese cook who wagged\\r\\n\\n\\nhis head at them every time he came out of the kitchen and said \"Velly\\r\\n\\n\\nnice lil gallee,\" to their great amusement. \"Oh, I do wish we could\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a Chinese cook when we get a house,\" said Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We are going to,\" answered Jack; \"Aunt Helen said so.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut it was all on account of her interest in John Chinaman that the\\r\\n\\n\\nday did not pass without trouble for Jack who, as usual, could not\\r\\n\\n\\nescape from some disaster. John, or Wah Sing as was his real name, was\\r\\n\\n\\ntrotting back and forth from kitchen to garden, his long queue neatly\\r\\n\\n\\nwound around the back of his head, and his shoes making little noise\\r\\n\\n\\nas he moved about. His blue jacket was a pleasant bit of color in the\\r\\n\\n\\nlandscape where the more brilliant hues of blossoms abounded. Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed after him, being vastly amused by his methods and finding\\r\\n\\n\\nin his childlike smile a certain fascination. When Jean had tired of\\r\\n\\n\\nwatching Wah Sing, Jack still hovered around him, but finally the\\r\\n\\n\\nfascination was changed into horror as she saw him secure two chickens\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich he carried to the kitchen door and left tied till he should go\\r\\n\\n\\ninside. Jack waited for him to come out. What was he going to do next?\\r\\n\\n\\nKill the chickens, she feared. Would he shoot them, wring their necks,\\r\\n\\n\\nchop off their heads?

With a shriek\\r\\n\\n\\nof protest Jack rushed forward, wrested the unfortunate chicken from\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Chinaman\\'s grasp, and fled toward the veranda, her hands smarting\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom holding the victim.

Mr. Pinckney seeing that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe carried matters a little too far said: \"It is all our fault, Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner. Mrs. Roberts and I told the kid that as you had four daughters\\r\\n\\n\\nyou might spare us one, and she seemed to think Prisms, here, could be\\r\\n\\n\\nmost readily parted with, so we have been teasing Mary Lee till the\\r\\n\\n\\nchild really believes we mean to wheedle you into giving her away.\\r\\n\\n\\nNow, if we take any one it must be the twins, for I have come to the\\r\\n\\n\\nconclusion that one will not be enough, for Mrs. Roberts might want\\r\\n\\n\\nher at the same time that I did and there would be trouble in the\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily, so we\\'ll take the twins, please.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was turning the tables on Jack who, when it came to the test, was\\r\\n\\n\\nappalled at the idea of belonging to any one but her mother, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nprecipitately fled to her room dragging Jean with her. After locking\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door they hid under the bed where they kept very quiet for a time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"They shan\\'t have us,\" whispered Jack. \"I don\\'t want to be adopted, do\\r\\n\\n\\nyou, Jean?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" agreed Jean, \"not even by Mr. St. Nick or Mrs. Bobs. I reckon he\\'d\\r\\n\\n\\ngive us lots of pretty things,\" she remarked after a short silence.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But we couldn\\'t have mother nor Nan nor Aunt Helen and we\\'d have to be\\r\\n\\n\\nnamed Pinckney or Roberts and we\\'d have to live here always,\" returned\\r\\n\\n\\nJack. \"It would be dreadful not to see our own kin, you know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it would,\" Jean answered. \"I want to belong to my own mother, I\\r\\n\\n\\nreckon. Do you suppose he\\'ll send a police officer after us?\" she asked\\r\\n\\n\\nafter a while.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, I don\\'t believe he would do that.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Nor soldiers.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Of course not; he\\'s not a general nor a king.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then why did we run and hide?\" asked Jean with less imagination than\\r\\n\\n\\nher twin sister.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, just because he might have grabbed us and have done something or\\r\\n\\n\\nother.\" Jack was rather vague as to her ideas of what was possible\\r\\n\\n\\ndanger to them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe he\\'ll forget it,\" said Jean when the time of imprisonment seemed\\r\\n\\n\\nbecoming wearisome and when no exciting pursuit thrilled her with alarm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps he will,\" Jack admitted, \"and at any rate he will know we\\r\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t want to be adopted and he\\'ll go home and tell Mrs. Bobs and she\\r\\n\\n\\nwill say, \\'Well, we\\'ll have to get some one else who has no mother.\\'\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want them to get any one else,\" said Jean, \"because,\" she', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

I believe there is only the mother and one daughter who\\r\\n\\n\\nare left.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Where is it? Very far?\" asked Nan eagerly. \"Could you and I go there\\r\\n\\n\\nby ourselves?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d better not attempt it,\" said Mrs. Corner. \"Wait till Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney comes and we learn more.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney arrived early in the afternoon. The carriage which he\\r\\n\\n\\ndrove would seat but three others, so Nan, by reason of her superior\\r\\n\\n\\nyears, was given a place to the great disappointment of the twins. They\\r\\n\\n\\nwere comforted, however, by Mr. Pinckney\\'s promise to take them the\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowing day, if it was decided that the house would suit.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t both go, anyhow,\" Mary Lee reminded them, \"so it will be\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch better to wait.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If Mr. St. Nick were not so fat I could sit with him and Nan,\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nJack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But he is fat, so there is no use if-ing,\" returned Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut though the twins were disappointed Nan was in her element. Such an\\r\\n\\n\\nexpedition appealed to her strongly; it had all the element of a voyage\\r\\n\\n\\nof discovery and meant much. Up the hillside they drove, passing quaint\\r\\n\\n\\nadobe houses of the old Spanish town, attracted by rose-embowered\\r\\n\\n\\ncottages, peeping in at some more pretentious mansion within whose\\r\\n\\n\\ngrounds grew palms and tropical plants. \"When you consider that the\\r\\n\\n\\ncity covers thirty-six square miles,\" remarked Mr. Pinckney, \"you may\\r\\n\\n\\nimagine that one can drive quite a distance before reaching the further\\r\\n\\n\\nedge. The house we are to see is in the suburbs and we have some way to\\r\\n\\n\\ngo.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Is it near Mrs. Roberts\\'?\" asked Nan eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Not very far; within easy walking distance; that is one of the\\r\\n\\n\\nadvantages, we think.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"There is the ocean,\" cried Nan, as a far-off glittering line of light\\r\\n\\n\\ncaught her eye.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That it is truly,\" replied Mr. Pinckney, \"and not so far off, either.\\r\\n\\n\\nWe are between what we might call \\'the devil and the deep blue sea,\\'\\r\\n\\n\\nfor those mountains can be pretty wicked looking in a storm.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a fair scene as observed from their final point of view; the\\r\\n\\n\\nriver winding its way through a narrow passage between high hills, the\\r\\n\\n\\ncity stretching away like a park beautified by sheltering trees, and\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a background the mountains never changing yet ever changeful.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If we had time I would suggest going a little further where we should\\r\\n\\n\\nfind a pretty little lake,\" said Mr. Pinckney. \"We have come beyond our\\r\\n\\n\\ndestination, but I wanted you to see this view which you can reach very\\r\\n\\n\\neasily from where we are going. Does it please you, ladies?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is magnificent,\" said Miss Helen delightedly. \"I am sure it will be\\r\\n\\n\\nworth a great deal to be neighbors to such a spot as this.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThey turned and drove slowly down hill till they reached a pleasant\\r\\n\\n\\nquiet street where the picturesque house stood. Nan could not contain\\r\\n\\n\\nher raptures but squealed out delightedly. \"Oranges, our own! See them\\r\\n\\n\\non the trees. Oh, look at the flowers! Grape-vines, mother! Aunt Helen,\\r\\n\\n\\njust look at that dear little orchard! Can that be an olive tree, a\\r\\n\\n\\nreal olive tree for us? And I am sure those are figs.

              " Document(page_content='comfortable and the question of taking it was decided then and there\\r\\n\\n\\nto Nan\\'s great delight. Mary Lee had not told the half. There were\\r\\n\\n\\npleasures in store of which she had not dreamed, Nan declared.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt did not take long to have the house put in order and to remove their\\r\\n\\n\\ntrunks to it, so in another week they were feeling quite at home. Then\\r\\n\\n\\ncame the question of a servant, though to the delight of the girls\\r\\n\\n\\nthe matter of lessons was not to be taken up just yet. Jack rebelled\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst having a Chinese servant, but finally gave in when she was\\r\\n\\n\\npromised that there should be no killing of chickens on the place and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat only those ready dressed should be brought from the market.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd therefore, one morning a bland, almond-eyed individual made his\\r\\n\\n\\nappearance before breakfast. He had been engaged by Mrs. Roberts for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Corners and came well recommended. Indeed Ming was a treasure and\\r\\n\\n\\nboth Mrs. Corner and Miss Helen congratulated themselves on having\\r\\n\\n\\nfound such a gem. But at the end of two weeks he suddenly announced\\r\\n\\n\\nthat he must go at once; he was \"solly\" but he had decided to go to\\r\\n\\n\\nNew York with a friend and open a laundry where he would make \"heap\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch money.\" Could he have an old umbrella which he had discovered\\r\\n\\n\\nstanding in the corner of the kitchen? He had heard that it rained a\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat deal in New York and it would be so useful to him. The umbrella\\r\\n\\n\\nwas his, Mrs. Corner told him, and he departed, seemingly grateful and\\r\\n\\n\\nregretful, after presenting each member of the family with a gift.\\r\\n\\n\\nFor a few days after this a procession of Chinamen walked in and out\\r\\n\\n\\nthe gate, but at last one was secured who seemed to offer the best\\r\\n\\n\\npossibilities and peace reigned in the household.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why did you leave your last place?\" was one of Mrs. Corner\\'s first\\r\\n\\n\\nquestions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Heap too stinge,\" replied Li Hung blandly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, we are not that,\" said Miss Helen with a laugh as she nodded\\r\\n\\n\\nto her sister, but in a private conference they decided that it would\\r\\n\\n\\nnot do to give out the groceries and such things to this sensitive\\r\\n\\n\\nChinaman, though it had been their custom at home to do so. \"All of the\\r\\n\\n\\nman\\'s references lay stress upon his honesty,\" said Miss Helen, \"and I\\r\\n\\n\\nthink we can risk it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nLi Hung, though not quite so capable as Ming, was nevertheless a\\r\\n\\n\\ngood-natured, kindly-disposed fellow, willing to do his best which best\\r\\n\\n\\nwas better than Mrs. Corner had found in her servants at home, so she\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not regret Ming although a funny sequel to his leave-taking was\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovered quite by accident.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why Mrs. Butler\\'s front door is never opened wide,\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nNan one day. \"I\\'ve noticed for a long time that when any one goes there\\r\\n\\n\\nthe door is opened only a tiny crack.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That reminds me,\" said Mrs. Corner, \"I must send over some Maryland\\r\\n\\n\\nbiscuits to Mrs. Butler; she was so kind when we first came and\\r\\n\\n\\nsupplied us with so many nice things when we were servantless. She says\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is very fond of beaten biscuits but has never had any out here.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo that very afternoon Nan was despatched to their opposite neighbor\\'s.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe house stood back some distance from the street, but its front door,\\r\\n\\n\\ndraped with roses was plainly visible from the Corners\\'. Nan rang the\\r\\n\\n\\nbell and in a few minutes the door opened a few inches. Nan stepped\\r\\n\\n\\ninside. The man who opened the door retreated partially behind it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Corner sends----\" began Nan, then she nearly dropped her plate in\\r\\n\\n\\nsurprise. \"Why, it\\'s Ming,\" she exclaimed. \"We thought you had gone to\\r\\n\\n\\nNew York.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Not yet. After while,\" he answered and bolted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently Mrs. Butler appeared. Nan gave her message with the plate of\\r\\n\\n\\nbiscuits and then said: \"I was so surprised to see Ming, Mrs. Butler;\\r\\n\\n\\nwe thought he had gone to New York.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Butler smiled. \"Why, did he live with you?

He told me he had left his\\r\\n\\n\\nlast place on that account.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How could we have company when we have just come and know scarcely any\\r\\n\\n\\none?\" said Nan in an aggrieved voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid Ming\\'s pride in his cookery overbalanced his consideration\\r\\n\\n\\nfor you,\" said Mrs. Butler. \"I never dreamed I was robbing you of a\\r\\n\\n\\ncapable man.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but we\\'re all right now,\" said Nan. \"We wouldn\\'t give up our man\\r\\n\\n\\nfor any one; we just love him,\" she added feeling afraid she had made\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Butler uncomfortable. But she went home wiser than before in her\\r\\n\\n\\nknowledge of \"ways that are dark and tricks that are vain.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was quite as she said; they would not give up Li Hung for any\\r\\n\\n\\nother, for he improved daily and they became greatly attached to the\\r\\n\\n\\ngood honest fellow. They discovered that he made frequent visits to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe capable Ming and in exchange for lending a helping hand was given\\r\\n\\n\\nlessons in cookery. As he did not neglect his own work to do this, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthey were the gainers by his adding new recipes to his list, nothing\\r\\n\\n\\nwas said. Except for these absences he rarely wanted to go out and gave\\r\\n\\n\\nhimself up heart and soul to the interests of the family. He never\\r\\n\\n\\nforgot the wild laughter which greeted the appearance of the first\\r\\n\\n\\npair of chickens he served. These he set on the table with an air of\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat pride, for they were done to a turn and looked delicious, but\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir trussed legs were pinned together with two large safety-pins\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich shone out in distinct contrast to the browned skin. Li Hung was\\r\\n\\n\\nmortified, but he lived and learned, for the next time the legs were\\r\\n\\n\\nneatly slipped in place, so had he benefited by a visit to Ming.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He is so beautifully clean,\" said Mrs. Corner with a satisfied sigh\\r\\n\\n\\nas he left the room one day. \"Where shall we find his like when we get\\r\\n\\n\\nback? Look at that spotless white jacket and that apron so smoothly\\r\\n\\n\\nstarched and ironed.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s tied the apron so tight that the back of his jacket sticks\\r\\n\\n\\nout like a fan-tailed pigeon,\" said Nan, \"but he is clean, and so\\r\\n\\n\\ngood-natured.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I never tasted such delicious strawberry short-cake,\" said Miss Helen\\r\\n\\n\\ndelicately nibbling at the last morsel in her plate. \"We must learn how\\r\\n\\n\\nhe makes it, Mary.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSo Li Hung became established as a member of the household and when the\\r\\n\\n\\ntime came that they must leave their pleasant quarters one of their\\r\\n\\n\\nchief regrets was giving up Li Hung who had been such a source of\\r\\n\\n\\ncomfort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nInto the new home they soon settled down with a feeling of perfect\\r\\n\\n\\ncontent. They were near enough to the centre of the city to be able to\\r\\n\\n\\nenjoy its privileges, yet they were surrounded by country sights and\\r\\n\\n\\nsounds.

There was much\\r\\n\\n\\naltercation over the virtues of these two dolls, Jean insisting that\\r\\n\\n\\nher Ming was superior to Jack\\'s Li Hung, but this dispute was not\\r\\n\\n\\nserious and life under the tepees was very happy. Sometimes Nan, in a\\r\\n\\n\\nfit of childishness, joined in their plays, taking the summer-house for\\r\\n\\n\\nher home and calling it Roseville, while the twins\\' place of residence\\r\\n\\n\\nshe dubbed Gunny-town.

The invitation ran as follows: \"You are honorably\\r\\n\\n\\nbidden to the Feast of Roses at the sign of the Golden Buds, Roseville,\\r\\n\\n\\nthis afternoon at four o\\'clock.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What is Nan up to now?\" asked Mrs. Corner as Jean handed her the note.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a great feast,\" said Jean importantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Some of Nan\\'s make believes that she so delights in,\" said Miss Helen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But where is the Golden Bud?\" Mrs. Corner asked Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You will know it by the golden buds over the door,\" said Jean, not too\\r\\n\\n\\nwilling to spoil Nan\\'s mysteries.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s in the summer-house, I imagine,\" said Miss Helen as Jean went\\r\\n\\n\\nout. \"We must be sure to go, Mary, or they will be dreadfully\\r\\n\\n\\ndisappointed.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPromptly at four o\\'clock the two ladies appeared at the door of the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle summer-house. \"How pretty!\" exclaimed Miss Helen as she put\\r\\n\\n\\nher head inside. The place was hung with small rosy lanterns and at\\r\\n\\n\\neach place was a big pink rose in the centre of which was burning a\\r\\n\\n\\ntiny candle. In the glass bowl of lemonade were floating rose-leaves,\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle rosebuds bordered the cake on the table and the tea-cups were\\r\\n\\n\\nwhite with a pattern of roses. The fragrant tea Li Hung had presented,\\r\\n\\n\\ntelling Nan that it was such as his countrymen used and that it was\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Heap much good.\" The cake, too, he had made. There were sandwiches of\\r\\n\\n\\ncrackers between which were pressed rose-leaves and there was a dish of\\r\\n\\n\\ncandied rose-leaves. The girls were all in pink with roses pinned on\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir frocks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I certainly think you deserve credit, Nan, for getting up such a\\r\\n\\n\\npretty feast,\" said her aunt. \"It is a shame there are so few to enjoy\\r\\n\\n\\nit.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Next time I will invite Mrs. Roberts and Mr. St. Nick,\" said Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll have something different then. But I didn\\'t do this all myself,\\r\\n\\n\\nAunt Helen; the girls all helped me and so did Li Hung.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it is quite too pretty not to be repeated,\" said Miss Helen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so the feasts were begun.

The first\\r\\n\\n\\nwas a tall angular elderly woman from Massachusetts who spoke with a\\r\\n\\n\\nstrong Yankee accent. She had taught a district school when she was\\r\\n\\n\\na girl and thought herself amply qualified to be a governess to four\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle girls; her attainments, however, were so few that in spite of\\r\\n\\n\\nher calm self-complacence she was dismissed in short order. The second\\r\\n\\n\\nwas a very young blooming girl, all fly-away feathers and be-ringed\\r\\n\\n\\nhands. She really didn\\'t have to teach, she informed Miss Helen, but\\r\\n\\n\\npapa wouldn\\'t give her enough pocket money and she wanted to buy some\\r\\n\\n\\nnew things; an evening cloak and a bracelet; she\\'d love to teach four\\r\\n\\n\\nsweet little girls and she wouldn\\'t be a bit strict. She was gently\\r\\n\\n\\ngiven to understand that she would not do and went away wondering why.\\r\\n\\n\\nThe third was a sharp-eyed young woman of whom Miss Helen actually\\r\\n\\n\\nhad hopes, for she seemed rather well qualified, but when she gave an\\r\\n\\n\\nexample of her musical performances by putting her foot on the loud\\r\\n\\n\\npedal and keeping it there during the whole time of her pounding out a\\r\\n\\n\\nshowy waltz, and when her French was tested, Miss Helen\\'s hopes waned,\\r\\n\\n\\nalthough she did take the young lady under consideration. \"I could give\\r\\n\\n\\nNan lessons myself, I suppose,\" she told Mrs. Corner, \"and the children\\r\\n\\n\\nneedn\\'t take up French.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No indeed; we\\'ll not have anything of that kind,\" replied the girls\\'\\r\\n\\n\\nmother. \"You are very good, Helen, but I don\\'t intend that you shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbother over Nan\\'s music when there must be suitably equipped teachers\\r\\n\\n\\nto be had. We\\'ll continue the search.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you didn\\'t take the black-eyed one,\" said Nan when number\\r\\n\\n\\nthree was finally set aside. \"She looked as hard as nails and I know\\r\\n\\n\\nshe and Jack would have been scrapping half the time. Do, dear Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen, pick out a nice, pretty, amiable somebody whom we can respect\\r\\n\\n\\nand yet who isn\\'t the bossy kind.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to reconcile yourselves to obeying a governess, Nan,\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we\\'ll obey all right; see if we don\\'t, but Jack and I do hate to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe visibly bossed. We don\\'t mind it so much when people don\\'t make a\\r\\n\\n\\nsharp point of things in that severe kind of way some people, like Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nSarah, for instance, have. We don\\'t have much respect either for people\\r\\n\\n\\nwho let us walk over them, so please get a governess that is just\\r\\n\\n\\nright.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" returned her aunt gravely, for she took the remarks to\\r\\n\\n\\nheart.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                               SEÑORITA\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was in old Sonora town that Miss Helen came across Señorita Dolores\\r\\n\\n\\nMendez de Garcia.

But a few of these now remained, though the quaint\\r\\n\\n\\none-storied, adobe structures, with their deep-niched windows, spoke\\r\\n\\n\\neloquently of a former régime. It was at the door of one of the best\\r\\n\\n\\npreserved of these houses that there stood a dark-eyed girl as Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen passed by. Her fair skin and soft brown hair marked her as\\r\\n\\n\\nunlike her dark-complexioned neighbors, and when she picked up the\\r\\n\\n\\nhandkerchief which Miss Helen accidentally dropped she returned it\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying, \"Permit me to return your handkerchief, madam.\" It was then\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Miss Helen marked the girl\\'s grace and refinement. \"Surely,\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid to herself, \"she is a descendant of some blue-blooded hidalgo.\\r\\n\\n\\nI should like to know more of her.\" Then as a sudden thought struck\\r\\n\\n\\nher she said to the girl, \"Could you recommend to me a good teacher of\\r\\n\\n\\nSpanish? I wish to take a few lessons.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe warm color spread over the girl\\'s soft cheeks as she replied\\r\\n\\n\\nhesitatingly: \"Perhaps if madame will allow me to call upon her I shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbe able to give her the information she desires.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen gave her address and made an appointment for the next day,\\r\\n\\n\\nthen she went on her way wondering if she had been too impulsive. The\\r\\n\\n\\nappointment was promptly kept and the conference was a long one. Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner was finally called in and the session continued behind closed\\r\\n\\n\\ndoors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What in the world do you suppose they can be talking about all this\\r\\n\\n\\ntime?\" said Nan to Mary Lee as the two swung in a hammock on the\\r\\n\\n\\nveranda. \"They\\'ve been there hours I do believe.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Aunt Helen said the young lady was to tell her about a Spanish\\r\\n\\n\\nteacher,\" returned Mary Lee, \"but I should think she must be giving a\\r\\n\\n\\nlesson herself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Hark, there is the piano,\" said Nan, \"and it is not Aunt Helen\\r\\n\\n\\nplaying. That surely must be a Spanish dance. Isn\\'t it lovely? It\\r\\n\\n\\nsounds like castanets and Moorish palaces and things.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, you are so romantic, Nan,\" said Mary Lee; \"you are always\\r\\n\\n\\nimagining all sorts of things.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She plays well,\" continued Nan without heeding her sister, and\\r\\n\\n\\nlistening intently to the music. \"I wonder if she plays the guitar or\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mandolin; I should love to hear her.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"They are coming out now,\" remarked Mary Lee after a pause. \"She is\\r\\n\\n\\nvery pretty, Nan, isn\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan drew herself up from her lounging position and Mary Lee did the\\r\\n\\n\\nsame. The movement attracted Miss Helen\\'s attention. \"Come here,\\r\\n\\n\\ngirls,\" she said, \"I want you to meet Miss de Garcia who will perhaps\\r\\n\\n\\nbe your teacher for the time you will be here.\" Miss Helen was anxious\\r\\n\\n\\nto note the effect upon the girls, of this latest applicant.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe young lady gave a flashing smile to each of the girls and extended\\r\\n\\n\\na slim hand. \"I am pleased to meet the young ladies,\" she said with a\\r\\n\\n\\nslight accent and deliberate utterance. \"We shall be good friends, yes?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girls were ready to promise friendship on the spot, and after a few\\r\\n\\n\\nmore words Miss de Garcia departed promising to be on hand the next\\r\\n\\n\\nmorning to begin her work.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs soon as she was out of hearing the questions began. \"Where did you\\r\\n\\n\\nfind her, Aunt Helen?

Oh, do tell us all about her.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I met her quite by accident,\" said Miss Helen, \"but I was charmed\\r\\n\\n\\nat once.

She speaks French as well as she does English, for\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was partially educated in France at a convent there, and spent a\\r\\n\\n\\nyear in England. She is an orphan who was adopted by her aunt when she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas scarce more than a baby. The aunt has since died, but the girl\\r\\n\\n\\nhas been living in the family of her aunt\\'s husband where I fancy she\\r\\n\\n\\nis not entirely happy. Now the uncle has married a second time and\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss de Garcia felt that her place in the household is not such as\\r\\n\\n\\nit was during her aunt\\'s lifetime, therefore she is very anxious to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe independent for she cannot bear to be a burden upon those to whom\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is not related by ties of blood. I learned this only through some\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle remarks she happened to make, for she made no complaints, yet I\\r\\n\\n\\njudge that is the situation.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She is the loveliest thing I ever saw,\" said Mary Lee with a long\\r\\n\\n\\nsigh. \"Those beautiful melting dark eyes, that lovely hair and that\\r\\n\\n\\nexquisite complexion; I shall love to sit and look at her.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: \"I SHALL LOVE TO SIT AND LOOK AT HER.\"]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"In which case you will not learn very much,\" returned Miss Helen\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughing. \"When Mary begins to get sentimental,\" she went on saying to\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner, \"I feel as if California were really going to our heads.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat have you to say, Miss Nan?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Words fail,\" replied Nan expressively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then you think she will do,\" said Miss Helen with a smile.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'s exactly right,\" returned Nan. \"Are you going to engage her, Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If her references prove satisfactory, as I have no doubt they will.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe seems to me really a great find. How often it is that we get what\\r\\n\\n\\nwe want quite by accident. After all our inquiries and advertisements\\r\\n\\n\\nto merely chance upon Miss Garcia seems queer. Her French is beautiful,\\r\\n\\n\\nand though she is not a great musician, she has temperament and has\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen taught in the right way.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I loved those things she was playing,\" said Nan. \"They were Spanish,\\r\\n\\n\\nweren\\'t they?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Some of them.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I thought so. I felt the castanets and tambourines were there.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen nodded approvingly. \"That\\'s it exactly. I am glad you\\r\\n\\n\\nrecognized just what I did. I shall certainly be disappointed now if\\r\\n\\n\\nthere is any adverse report.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Whom does she give as reference?\" inquired Mrs. Corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"An old priest, an antique Spanish lady and her uncle, but,\" seeing\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner\\'s doubtful expression, \"I am content with them. She has\\r\\n\\n\\nnot lived in this city long and has made few friends. If we could wait\\r\\n\\n\\nshe would like me to write to the heads of the schools where she was\\r\\n\\n\\neducated: the convent mother in France and the principal of the English\\r\\n\\n\\nschool, but I think we can waive that. Aren\\'t you satisfied, Mary?\\r\\n\\n\\nWould you rather wait?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am perfectly satisfied if you are.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then to-morrow I will start out upon my visits to her three friends. I\\r\\n\\n\\nshall rather enjoy myself, I fancy. One doesn\\'t often have a chance to\\r\\n\\n\\nmeet such people in anything like an intimate way.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen was not disappointed in her expectations, for she did enjoy\\r\\n\\n\\nher visits. \"The old priest is a dear,\" she reported, \"and Señora\\r\\n\\n\\nRodriguez is perfectly charming. I wish you could hear her broken\\r\\n\\n\\nEnglish and see the way she uses her fan in those lovely slim hands of\\r\\n\\n\\nhers. As for the uncle he is a quiet, grave sort of man. He has found\\r\\n\\n\\nlife a disappointment, I should imagine, for he has such a sombre face\\r\\n\\n\\nand never once smiled.

She was as much excited as Mary Lee and was usually\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch more romantic, yet, strange to say, it was Mary Lee who gave a\\r\\n\\n\\ndoting affection to the new governess. Nan admired her immensely and\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt the influence of her gentle dignity, but Mary Lee fell in love\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her in that fond and foolish way that girls sometimes have. She\\r\\n\\n\\nwas always at the gate to watch for her approach; she hoarded up\\r\\n\\n\\ndainties for her until her mother said she believed Mary Lee grudged\\r\\n\\n\\nthe entire family anything specially good.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Garcia accepted all these attentions with a grave graciousness,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut was not spoiled by them. \"She is just like a queen,\" said Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d love to dress her in silks and satins and shower jewels upon her.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe dresses so very plainly. Do you suppose she hasn\\'t any real nice\\r\\n\\n\\nthings?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t suppose she has,\" returned Nan, to whom the remark was made.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She would look lovely in fine fixings, wouldn\\'t she? I suppose her\\r\\n\\n\\nuncle is not well off, and he has a wife and children to support.\\r\\n\\n\\nI shouldn\\'t wonder if they had had money though, for the other day\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was speaking of the great estates the Spaniards used to have and\\r\\n\\n\\ntold how they had lost them all. I should think they would hate the\\r\\n\\n\\nAmericans.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I reckon they do,\" said Mary Lee, \"but my señorita doesn\\'t hate us.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Your señorita! You would suppose you had discovered her and then\\r\\n\\n\\nbought her,\" replied Nan in a vexed tone. \"I declare, Mary Lee, you\\r\\n\\n\\nmake me ill the way you go on, and I don\\'t believe she cares for you\\r\\n\\n\\nany more than for the rest of us. I believe she is fondest of Jean,\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was gall and bitterness to poor Mary Lee, who felt such jealous\\r\\n\\n\\npangs as never before had she endured and which had the effect of\\r\\n\\n\\nsending her with a miserable countenance to the further end of the\\r\\n\\n\\nveranda when Miss de Garcia next came.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why do you retire so far from the ozzers?\" asked the governess. \"I\\r\\n\\n\\ncannot hear you so well.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee edged a little nearer but sat gloweringly through the lesson\\r\\n\\n\\nhours. She kept her place, however, after the rest were free, and let\\r\\n\\n\\nher eyes linger on her teacher\\'s head, bent over some exercises she was\\r\\n\\n\\ncorrecting. After a while the exercises were laid aside with a sigh and\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss de Garcia smiled upon her adoring pupil.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee moved toward her. \"Are you tired?\" she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"A little; not too much. Have you somesin for me to explain to you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee dropped a light kiss upon her teacher\\'s bright hair. \"I didn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nwait for that,\" she said, then all the pain of her jealousy found\\r\\n\\n\\nrelief in the words: \"I love you so. May I call you Miss Dolores? It is\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch a beautiful name.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do you like it? My aunt was named so. If you like, yes.

When\\r\\n\\n\\nI was sixteen I went to France with my aunt, who placed me in school;\\r\\n\\n\\nafter I was in England one year, then I returned to see my aunt die, my\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfazer\\'s estates wasted, my uncle in poverty and myself at last, as\\r\\n\\n\\nyou might say homeless Now that my mozer\\'s people are all gone, I wish\\r\\n\\n\\nif I might know some of my own blood, for my uncle who is kind is made\\r\\n\\n\\nmore poor by another marriage to a widow who had children. I am alone.\"\\r\\n\\n\\nShe said these last words so sadly that Mary Lee was seized with an\\r\\n\\n\\noverwhelming pity, and kneeling down showered kisses upon her hands.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You are not alone,\" she cried. \"We love you; all of us do. Oh, if\\r\\n\\n\\nmother and Aunt Helen would only take you home with us you should never\\r\\n\\n\\nfeel alone.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe tears rose to Miss de Garcia\\'s eyes. \"I have talked too much of\\r\\n\\n\\nmyself,\" she said, \"but it has done me good. It is my birthday and no\\r\\n\\n\\none knew. You are very kind, very dear, to feel so sympathy for me; as\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Spanish say, you are very friend to me. I shall not forget, Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee, but I must go now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How I love to hear you roll your R\\'s,\" said Mary Lee. \"Please don\\'t go\\r\\n\\n\\njust yet; wait till I come back.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe rushed off to her mother and aunt. \"Mother, Aunt Helen,\" she cried,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"can\\'t we invite Miss Dolores to stay to dinner with us? It is her\\r\\n\\n\\nbirthday and no one knows, and mayn\\'t I make a birthday cake for her?\\r\\n\\n\\nI think I could if Nan would help me. Oh, please say yes. Won\\'t you go\\r\\n\\n\\nright out, mother, and ask her to stay? I am so afraid she won\\'t wait.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, my dear,\" Mrs. Corner looked at her sister. \"Certainly we shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbe glad to ask her. Her birthday, did you say? Then I will order\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething extra.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do you suppose she will have to have tortillas and tamales and such\\r\\n\\n\\nthings?\" asked Mary Lee eagerly, turning to her aunt as her mother\\r\\n\\n\\nleft the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Nonsense,\" said Miss Helen. \"You forget, Mary Lee, that she has lived\\r\\n\\n\\nin Paris and England, and is quite used to different dishes, beside\\r\\n\\n\\nthere is no doubt but she will enjoy a change from frijoles negros and\\r\\n\\n\\nred pepper.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I hope she\\'ll stay,\" said Mary Lee, clasping her hands anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think she is going to,\" said Miss Helen, going to the window. \"I see\\r\\n\\n\\nshe is sitting down again. I must go out and talk to her.

It would never have done to invade his kingdom, and when the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirls wanted to prepare anything themselves they always took to the\\r\\n\\n\\nbuttery, though Li Hung always smilingly allowed them to use the stove\\r\\n\\n\\nand was ready to help when they required his aid. Mary Lee was bubbling\\r\\n\\n\\nover with excitement. Her usual calmness had disappeared entirely under\\r\\n\\n\\npressure of the occasion. She poured forth into Nan\\'s willing ear the\\r\\n\\n\\nstory she had heard from Miss Dolores. \"Isn\\'t it romantic?\" she said at\\r\\n\\n\\nlast, pausing to take breath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I should think so,\" returned Nan, briskly beating eggs. \"Why, Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee, it is just like Ramona. She was adopted by her aunt and didn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nknow her father\\'s name and all that. Isn\\'t it queer? Do you suppose\\r\\n\\n\\nshe will marry an Indian like Allessandro? Dear me, it is just like a\\r\\n\\n\\nstory.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t just like Ramona,\" said Mary Lee the literal, \"for you know\\r\\n\\n\\nher father gave her to the Señora Ramona, who was no relation at all,\\r\\n\\n\\nand then _she_ gave her to her sister, Felipe\\'s mother. Besides her\\r\\n\\n\\nfather was a Scotchman, not an American.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it is near enough alike,\" returned Nan, seeing things less in\\r\\n\\n\\ndetail. \"It must be very funny not to know who your father was. I\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder if he was a criminal or a gambler or had killed some one. You\\r\\n\\n\\nknow what wild, lawless men used to come West in those days.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, they did at first I know, when the old forty-niners began\\r\\n\\n\\nto search for gold, but this was later, for Miss Dolores is only\\r\\n\\n\\ntwenty-two.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, but even then it wasn\\'t like it is now. Mr. St. Nick said when\\r\\n\\n\\nhe first came out here in 1880, Los Angeles was a very small place, the\\r\\n\\n\\nstreets were not paved and most of the houses were of adobe, so it\\r\\n\\n\\ncouldn\\'t have been so awfully civilized.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I shouldn\\'t want to say that before Miss Dolores. Her people think the\\r\\n\\n\\nAmericans have spoiled all the old elegance of the Spanish days.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why do you call her Miss Dolores? I think the señorita sounds much\\r\\n\\n\\nprettier; it makes her seem Spanish right off.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But I think Dolores is so beautiful; it means sorrow, she told me\\r\\n\\n\\nonce, and I think it seems more intimate to say Miss Dolores.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you may call her that, but I shall say señorita. Any one could\\r\\n\\n\\nbe named Dolores, but no one would think of calling any but a Spanish\\r\\n\\n\\nlady señorita, just as you would say mademoiselle to a French woman.\\r\\n\\n\\nTake care, Mary Lee, you are putting in too much flour; the cook book\\r\\n\\n\\nsays scant cups, not heaping ones.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, does it?\" Mary Lee emptied out some of the contents of her\\r\\n\\n\\nover-full cup before she stirred the flour into the mixture.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now beat like mad,\" said Nan, \"and here, let me put in some of the\\r\\n\\n\\nbeaten whites of the eggs before you add more flour.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I do hope it will be good,\" said Mary Lee watching her sister\\r\\n\\n\\nslide off some of the frothy heap into the cake bowl. \"Did you tell Li\\r\\n\\n\\nHung this was to be a birthday dinner?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, but I will tell him.\" When she carried the cake out to put it in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe oven she gave the information to the Chinaman, who looked pleased;\\r\\n\\n\\nhe liked opportunities to try his powers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You likee I make plitty salad?\" he asked. \"Plitty flowel, plitty\\r\\n\\n\\nnamee?

She had rummaged through her own\\r\\n\\n\\nbelongings and had appealed to her mother and aunt so that each one\\r\\n\\n\\nhad some gift to lay by Miss de Garcia\\'s plate. The twins produced\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo souvenirs which they had bought in San Diego: a little box of\\r\\n\\n\\norangewood and a paper cutter, Mrs. Corner contributed a small Indian\\r\\n\\n\\nbasket, Miss Helen a pretty fan, and Nan, in desperation at being out\\r\\n\\n\\nof it all by remaining so long in the kitchen, dragged from her trunk\\r\\n\\n\\na photograph of the old San Diego mission and tied it up hastily. Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee sacrificed her beloved Venetian beads which she admired almost more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan any of her possessions, yet nothing was too good for the señorita\\r\\n\\n\\nand she would have the pleasure of seeing her wear them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTherefore, when the guest of honor was ushered to the table she was\\r\\n\\n\\noverpowered by the array before her. Tears came to her eyes and for\\r\\n\\n\\na moment she could not speak, then when she did the Spanish words\\r\\n\\n\\nslipped between the English ones when she tried to express her thanks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Amigas mias,\" she began--\"my friends, you have made me glad, ashamed,\\r\\n\\n\\nmuy felices--so happy. I cannot say my thanks. Mil gracias señoras,\\r\\n\\n\\nseñoritas.

I want to\\r\\n\\n\\nuntie Li Hung, and I\\'m not through with the boy yet; he won\\'t say he is\\r\\n\\n\\nsorry.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think he has had enough?\" asked the young man. \"How long\\r\\n\\n\\nhave you been at it?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, not very long,\" said Jack looking down at her victim and pounding\\r\\n\\n\\nmore gently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Will you say you\\'re sorry, boy?\" asked the newcomer.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t,\" said the boy. \"Say, help me up, mister, and I\\'ll show\\r\\n\\n\\nyou how I can give it to her. I\\'ll do her up good if she is a girl.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ll do nothing of the kind,\" replied the young man sternly. \"I\\'ll\\r\\n\\n\\ntell you what I\\'ll do,\" he went on addressing Jack; \"I\\'ll go in and\\r\\n\\n\\nunfasten the Chinaman while you finish up the boy; he deserves it, I\\'m\\r\\n\\n\\nconvinced.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this encouragement Jack proceeded more vigorously with her\\r\\n\\n\\npunishment of the boy who kicked and squirmed, but could not unseat his\\r\\n\\n\\nchastiser. In a few minutes the young man reappeared. \"He\\'s all right,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said nodding toward Li Hung who stood at the gate, basket on arm.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Shall we let the Chinaman have a whack at you, boy, or have you had\\r\\n\\n\\nenough? I\\'ve a mind to give you one or two myself for saying you would\\r\\n\\n\\npitch into a girl when you know she was in the right. Here now, young\\r\\n\\n\\nlady, I reckon we\\'ll call time. Now, get out, youngster,\" he gave the\\r\\n\\n\\nboy a little touch with his foot, \"and if you ever get into any such\\r\\n\\n\\ntrouble again when I am around I\\'ll do the punishing myself. Get out,\\r\\n\\n\\nquick.\" He lifted Jack up bodily and the boy staggered to his feet,\\r\\n\\n\\nstood for a second, then as Li Hung made a lunge at him, took to his\\r\\n\\n\\nheels and was out of sight in a moment.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Missee plitty fine gallee; plunis boy allee lite,\" said Li Hung with a\\r\\n\\n\\nbeaming smile. \"Li Hung likee lil gallee Jack.\" He trotted back to the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse while Jack brushed from her frock the dust of the fray.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m awfully glad that you came along,\" she said to her new\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintance. \"I didn\\'t dare get up, you see, because I was afraid the\\r\\n\\n\\nboy would pitch into me and Li Hung couldn\\'t get free to go tell any\\r\\n\\n\\none.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It was an awkward predicament,\" said the young man. \"It seems to me\\r\\n\\n\\nyou are a spunky young lady to start this thing when you didn\\'t know', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

It was such a\\r\\n\\n\\nmean scurvy trick. I can\\'t bear to see anybody do another so mean. It\\r\\n\\n\\ncertainly was mighty low-down of that boy.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Say,\" said the young man, \"where are you from?

I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan find satisfactory references as to who I am, I think, and I reckon\\r\\n\\n\\nI can explain how I came to make your acquaintance without giving you\\r\\n\\n\\naway. I\\'ll go around to the front gate, shall I?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, please, and I\\'ll go in the back way and tell Li Hung not to say\\r\\n\\n\\nanything about the fight. Come slowly so I will have time to tell\\r\\n\\n\\nhim.\" She started toward the gate, then came back. \"Will it be very\\r\\n\\n\\ndeceitful,\" she said, \"not to tell mother all about it at once? She\\r\\n\\n\\nmightn\\'t let me go with you if she thought I had done wrong.

He was flat down, you see, and she was sitting on\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. She pounded him well, I tell you.

A smile played about her\\r\\n\\n\\nmouth. \"What was the Chinaman doing all this time?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Just placidly going on with his work,\" returned Carter.

My sister, Miss Corner, Mr. Barnwell.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen gave a pleased exclamation. \"I wonder if you could, by\\r\\n\\n\\nany chance, be the son of my old friend Molly Carter.

As soon as things looked as if they might become too\\r\\n\\n\\nserious I spoke out. You really haven\\'t said anything worth listening\\r\\n\\n\\nto yet. The only remark that impressed me at all was that which\\r\\n\\n\\nannounced that you weren\\'t perfect. I thought you all were.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s too beautiful a compliment to pass over,\" said Nan. \"You are\\r\\n\\n\\nforgiven.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I can tell you I think, what is at present occupying the thoughts of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour elders in there.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What?

Is that it?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That is it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"When?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To-morrow, if the powers so decide. That is probably what your aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nand mother are considering now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m going right in to see,\" said Nan laying down scissors and string\\r\\n\\n\\nand rushing off. She was back in a few minutes. \"We\\'re going, we\\'re\\r\\n\\n\\ngoing!\" she cried. \"Jack, go find Mary Lee and Jean and tell them to\\r\\n\\n\\ncome right here; we must have the fun of talking it all over. Carter,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou are a brick.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So glad.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s better than a brick,\" said Jack throwing affectionate arms around\\r\\n\\n\\nhim; \"he is a darling. I want to kiss him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You embarrass me. I\\'m blushing,\" cried Carter pretending to hide his\\r\\n\\n\\nface while Jack bestowed a cyclonic kiss upon his ear, and Nan laughed\\r\\n\\n\\nat his pretended coyness. Then off skipped Jack to find the other two\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters and soon the whole party was busily talking over the morrow\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nexcursion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nEarly the next day Carter appeared with the large touring car in which\\r\\n\\n\\nthey were to go, and there was much excitement among the children in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe getting off.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a ride of forty-eight miles to the Camulos ranch, and if they\\r\\n\\n\\nshould conclude to extend it further to Santa Barbara they would\\r\\n\\n\\ntravel over a hundred miles, but the further the better, said the young\\r\\n\\n\\npeople.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt promised to be a delightful trip. Each of the girls settled herself\\r\\n\\n\\naccording to her liking. Mary Lee with Miss Dolores by her side was\\r\\n\\n\\nsupremely happy, while Jean was content to sit on the same seat with\\r\\n\\n\\nthese two. Nan could turn to her Aunt Helen on her right and to her\\r\\n\\n\\nmother on her left, so she was suited, while Jack occupied what to her\\r\\n\\n\\nwas the place of honor, by Carter\\'s side. His goggles sent her into\\r\\n\\n\\nshrieks of laughter every time he turned his eyes her way. \"You look\\r\\n\\n\\nlike some funny bug,\" she told him. \"Like a grasshopper on its hind\\r\\n\\n\\nlegs, with poppy eyes and a funny cap.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Look here; stop making fun of me,\" said Carter in pretended\\r\\n\\n\\nresentment. \"I\\'ll tell your mother on you. Mrs. ----\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t call her,\" said Jack in alarm, \"she might make me change\\r\\n\\n\\nseats with Jean, and I don\\'t want to.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"After that subtle compliment, I can\\'t do anything worse than stop the\\r\\n\\n\\nmachine in the middle of the road and leave you to get home the best\\r\\n\\n\\nway you can.

              " Document(page_content='Aunt Helen. \"Isn\\'t it wonderful to think that we are going through\\r\\n\\n\\nCalifornia in something as if we were flying through the clouds in a\\r\\n\\n\\nchariot?

Do you suppose there was really a Ramona? I like\\r\\n\\n\\nto think so.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We can pretend there was even if there wasn\\'t,\" answered her aunt.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was always ready to humor Nan\\'s imagination. \"We\\'ll give her the\\r\\n\\n\\nbenefit of the doubt and Allessandro, too. The fact that the Camulos\\r\\n\\n\\nranch still exists and is the very spot where the scene of Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nJackson\\'s story is laid, makes it seem very real.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs they approached the place, Nan grew fidgety. She stood up every few\\r\\n\\n\\nminutes and craned her neck to see the low adobe house made so famous\\r\\n\\n\\nby the writer. At last there it was with its broad verandas; there was\\r\\n\\n\\nthe inner court open on the east, there the room occupied by Ramona.\\r\\n\\n\\nOn the south veranda Felipe had rested while Allessandro played upon\\r\\n\\n\\nhis violin. Yonder to the west was the little chapel and there hung the\\r\\n\\n\\nthree old bells brought from Spain so long ago. On the east side of the\\r\\n\\n\\ngarden a long arbor led to the little brook where Ramona\\'s lover first\\r\\n\\n\\nbeheld her washing the altar cloth. All these sights gave thrills to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe girls and indeed their elders were not unmoved. The señorita felt\\r\\n\\n\\nat home on what to her seemed Spanish soil and the others felt as if\\r\\n\\n\\nthey had stepped back into a past age.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCourteously the family invited them to remain as long as it suited\\r\\n\\n\\nthem, and even offered to entertain them at the next meal. Dinner\\r\\n\\n\\nthey had taken on the way, and though it was a great temptation to\\r\\n\\n\\nremain under the historic roof, the travelers felt that it would be\\r\\n\\n\\nan imposition to linger beyond such time as they might satisfy their\\r\\n\\n\\ninterest in H. H\\'s lovely story. Therefore when they had given a proper\\r\\n\\n\\namount of time to examining the various places they left the old house\\r\\n\\n\\nset in among its great vineyards, olive groves and orange trees, and\\r\\n\\n\\nresumed their journey to Santa Barbara which they hoped to reach before\\r\\n\\n\\nnight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe beautiful Santa Clara valley with its river meadows still green\\r\\n\\n\\nand lovely, was a pleasant place to travel through or to linger in,\\r\\n\\n\\nand Miss Helen declared that they must take a more leisurely journey\\r\\n\\n\\nthrough it, and perhaps spend some time at Santa Barbara when they\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be journeying toward the north.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan\\'s raptures had subsided under the sight of realities and for\\r\\n\\n\\nsome time she sat silently dreaming, following Ramona through her\\r\\n\\n\\nsad experiences, but suddenly a sharp report made her spring to her\\r\\n\\n\\nfeet and indeed caused every one to give an alarmed exclamation. The\\r\\n\\n\\nautomobile came to a standstill. Carter clambered down and looked\\r\\n\\n\\ncontemplatively at one of the tires. \"The blamed old thing has busted,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said. \"There\\'s something else wrong, too,\" he went on. \"I don\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nknow just what till I examine.

Your family?\" he said jovially to Carter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am not a Mormon and these are not my seven wives,\" replied Carter\\r\\n\\n\\nin the same spirit. \"We\\'ve come up from Los Angeles in an automobile,\\r\\n\\n\\nand the beastly thing has broken down out there on the road.

The\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle gal don\\'t have many playmates. I\\'m laying out to send her away\\r\\n\\n\\nto a good school when she gets bigger. She don\\'t have anything but dogs\\r\\n\\n\\nand cats to play with out here. Ah, Bessie,\" he called again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently a little girl about the age of the twins came running around\\r\\n\\n\\nthe corner of the house. She stopped short at sight of the visitors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Come along, Bess; they won\\'t bite you,\" said the man.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe child came nearer and regarded the twins interestedly. Jean gave\\r\\n\\n\\nher a beaming smile which was answered in kind, and seeing that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe mountain would not come to Mahomet, the twins decided that it\\r\\n\\n\\nwould have to be the other way, and both went forward to make the\\r\\n\\n\\nacquaintance of little Bessie Sanders. In a short time the three were\\r\\n\\n\\nplaying together, and making a friendly tour of inspection, Bessie\\r\\n\\n\\npiloting them all over the place to view \"the orchard, the meadow, the\\r\\n\\n\\ndeep tangled wild-wood,\" though instead of \"the rude bucket which hung\\r\\n\\n\\nin the well\" there were big windmills to draw up the water for use in\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse and garden.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan, Mary Lee and the señorita left their elders sitting on the\\r\\n\\n\\nveranda, Mrs. Sanders a pleasant, homely woman, being glad to\\r\\n\\n\\nentertain them while the girls and their governess wandered out to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe orange grove where the great golden globes of luscious fruit were\\r\\n\\n\\nhanging. \"Help yourselves to anything you see,\" had been Mr. Sanders\\'\\r\\n\\n\\nhospitable charge, and they did not disregard it when it came to\\r\\n\\n\\noranges.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

I knew de Garcia well in Mexico where I\\r\\n\\n\\nwas for several years before I was married. Then I lost sight of him,\\r\\n\\n\\nthough I heard he had come to California.

Where is your uncle now?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He has gone back to Mexico. For a little while he is living in Los\\r\\n\\n\\nAngeles, but he likes it not so well.

Her\\r\\n\\n\\npeople were my good friends. Fine old man your grandfather.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee listened attentively to all this. Anything which pertained\\r\\n\\n\\nto her dear Miss Dolores was of the greatest importance to her.\\r\\n\\n\\nFortunately she remembered the conversation afterward, and it was well\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she did; on such slight threads do fortune or misfortune hang.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter returned later with the necessary things to doctor up the motor\\r\\n\\n\\ncar, but it was too late to start for Santa Barbara that day and as Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nSanders insisted upon keeping the party for over night, they consented\\r\\n\\n\\nto stay as it was evidently his wish. The next morning it was decided\\r\\n\\n\\nto return home and make the trip to Santa Barbara when the flower\\r\\n\\n\\nfestival should take place, and when they could remain as long as they\\r\\n\\n\\nfelt inclined.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Li Hung will not know what has become of us,\" said Mrs. Corner, \"for\\r\\n\\n\\nI told him we would be back by this evening, and to-morrow will be\\r\\n\\n\\nSunday, Helen, so I think we would better go back, for you know we\\r\\n\\n\\npromised to dine with the Robertses to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen agreed that they must not go on, though the younger ones\\r\\n\\n\\nbegged hard not to go back.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You will let Bessie come to see us, won\\'t you, Mr. Sanders?\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nJean, who had taken a fancy to the little girl.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure I will,\" was the reply. \"And when you come this way you\\r\\n\\n\\nmust all stop as long as you can.

Already the mountain crests\\r\\n\\n\\nshowed snowy peaks, but the valleys had for some time displayed a\\r\\n\\n\\nlively green after the rainless summer, and since the first light\\r\\n\\n\\nshowers had given new life. Nan sat at her window looking off at the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountains and humming a little Spanish air she had been practicing. She\\r\\n\\n\\nstrummed a noiseless accompaniment on the pane as her thoughts were\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowing out a line of possibilities which a talk with Mary Lee had\\r\\n\\n\\nstarted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The señorita looks so sad,\" Mary Lee had remarked, \"I am sure she is\\r\\n\\n\\nthinking of how alone in the world she is.

Poor old Uplands all in ruins. Daniella was\\r\\n\\n\\nwith us then. I wonder where she is now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind about Daniella, let us talk about Miss Dolores,\" said Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee. \"Wouldn\\'t it be fine if she could discover something about her\\r\\n\\n\\nfather?

You are always so clever about\\r\\n\\n\\npuzzling out things.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan felt that after her teasing remarks she did not deserve this\\r\\n\\n\\ncompliment to her powers, and in return became as serious as her sister\\r\\n\\n\\ncould desire. \"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" she said after having\\r\\n\\n\\ngiven the subject grave consideration for a few minutes. \"We\\'ll tell\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. St. Nick about it; there\\'s no telling what he may advise.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"When he couldn\\'t find his own daughter-in-law I don\\'t believe he could\\r\\n\\n\\ndo much for Miss Dolores,\" argued Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, he will know better than any one else how to set about it.

How\\r\\n\\n\\nhe did enjoy Christmas.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How we all did enjoy it,\" said Mary Lee. \"Don\\'t you love your crêpe\\r\\n\\n\\nkimono and those lovely fans and things they gave us?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I certainly do. We really never had a better Christmas, although we\\r\\n\\n\\nwere away from home. Last year mother was away and that took off the\\r\\n\\n\\nedge from everything.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is a great thing to have money,\" remarked Mary Lee sententiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Last year we were so awfully poor and were at our wits\\' ends to know\\r\\n\\n\\nhow we could get presents for everybody and this year all we had to do\\r\\n\\n\\nwas to buy things.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure but I liked the old way better,\" returned Nan\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughtfully. \"There was more of ourselves in the things we gave.\" They\\r\\n\\n\\nlapsed into silence each wandering back into the ways of the old home\\r\\n\\n\\nlife. Nan broke the silence by saying, \"There comes Carter in all the\\r\\n\\n\\nrain. Shall we go in to see him or shall we leave him to the señorita?\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe asked mirthfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor answer Mary Lee stalked indignantly away but was recalled as Nan\\r\\n\\n\\nsang after her: \"Oh, Mrs. Barnwell, don\\'t get jealous.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell mother how you behave,\" said Mary Lee on the verge of tears.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She won\\'t like your talking that way anyhow; she\\'ll say it is very\\r\\n\\n\\nsilly and pert and--and--you know she won\\'t like it, Nancy Corner.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan well knew her mother would not like such silly speeches and as Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee moved off she called after her: \"I take it all back, Mary Lee.

After lessons Jean almost daily was seen running down street to\\r\\n\\n\\nwhere Mrs. Roberts lived and Nan often followed to talk to Mr. Pinckney\\r\\n\\n\\nwho enjoyed her bright sallies and queer whimsies. The Corners had\\r\\n\\n\\nmade other acquaintances, but the Robertses and Mr. Pinckney stood\\r\\n\\n\\nfirst in their affections while Carter had become almost one of the\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe storm was over by the next day and now could be expected a period\\r\\n\\n\\nof sunshiny weather till the February rains began. It was a time of\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch dreaming to Nan. Old Spain appealed to her so that she often lived\\r\\n\\n\\nin its past history and looked with inward eye upon the California of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe eighteenth century, yet she was quite as much interested in the\\r\\n\\n\\nprogress of modern enterprise and took in quickly all that was told her\\r\\n\\n\\nof newer methods and of the opening up of the country. Mary Lee, too,\\r\\n\\n\\nhad her dreams, but they were all for the señorita. What if her father\\r\\n\\n\\nwas not dead, that he could be discovered not the worthless renegade\\r\\n\\n\\nwhom every one supposed him to be, but a man whom time had made\\r\\n\\n\\nimportant, who now possessed wealth and station in which his daughter\\r\\n\\n\\ncould share. She confided these dreams to Nan sometimes but never to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe señorita. Yet Nan who could ordinarily plunge into the wildest\\r\\n\\n\\nregions of improbability was here practical.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If she had such a father don\\'t you suppose he would have found her\\r\\n\\n\\nout long ago?\" she would ask. \"He must have known her mother\\'s people\\r\\n\\n\\nand it would have been easy enough to find them.\" So Mary Lee\\'s hopes\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the moment would be crushed, though they would soon grow apace as\\r\\n\\n\\nsome new possibility presented itself, and she would come to Nan with\\r\\n\\n\\nsome such remark as: \"Surely Miss Dolores\\'s uncle would know about her\\r\\n\\n\\nfather.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But he won\\'t tell,\" Nan would remind her. \"He promised her aunt on her\\r\\n\\n\\ndeath bed as she had promised her father before her never to tell who\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was. It is like the most mysterious sort of story.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nSunday afternoon came their opportune moment to confide in Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney. Jean and Jack were absorbed in a trayful of sea shells which\\r\\n\\n\\nafforded them no end of amusement. They were playing a Sunday play,\\r\\n\\n\\nthey explained. The red deep lacquer tray was the Red Sea, the white\\r\\n\\n\\nshells were the children of Israel who were to go over on dry land; the\\r\\n\\n\\ncolored shells were the Egyptians who should be drowned in crossing,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor Jack had a tumbler of water ready for the right moment. She assured\\r\\n\\n\\nNan that Mrs. Roberts had told her the water would hurt neither shells\\r\\n\\n\\nnor tray and they expected much satisfaction in overwhelming Pharaoh\\r\\n\\n\\nand his host.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner with Miss Helen was talking to Mrs. Roberts in a corner of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe pleasant living-room, Carter and the señorita had sauntered into\\r\\n\\n\\nthe garden and therefore Nan and Mary Lee pounced upon Mr. Pinckney as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was taking his after dinner cigar on the veranda.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now, Miss Zeph,\" he said as the two girls settled themselves near him,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"you can just tell me a story. I feel lazy and want to be amused.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan looked at Mary Lee. \"Let\\'s tell him about the señorita,\" she said\\r\\n\\n\\nsuddenly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee looked approval. \"It\\'s a mighty romantic story,\" she remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but you have told it to me,\" he said. \"I want something quite\\r\\n\\n\\nfresh and new.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t told you near all,\" said Nan. \"Did you know, for instance,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she had an American father?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No.\" He looked surprised, then he asked: \"Who was he?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney sat up and appeared more interested. \"She doesn\\'t know?\\r\\n\\n\\nHow is that?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, her mother married against her father\\'s wishes and when Miss', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

Her aunt made Mr. Garcia promise not to tell and he won\\'t, so Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nDolores can\\'t find out anything. Her aunt used to be quite well off and\\r\\n\\n\\neducated Miss Dolores beautifully, but now her uncle has lost almost\\r\\n\\n\\neverything and she has no other relatives. There were only the two\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters, her aunt and her mother. One was named Dolores and the other\\r\\n\\n\\nElvira.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Elvira?\" Mr Pinckney spoke the name slowly and thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it isn\\'t as pretty a name as Dolores, do you think?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe did not answer, but sat with his head thrown back puffing at his\\r\\n\\n\\ncigar and watching the smoke drift off among the vines.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee took up the tale. \"We think, or at least Nan says, that\\r\\n\\n\\nprobably her father was a convict or something, or maybe just a\\r\\n\\n\\ngambler, and that her mother\\'s family were ashamed of him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney roused himself. \"Very likely, very likely. That would\\r\\n\\n\\nexplain it of course.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Still maybe he wasn\\'t, and if he was maybe his family are good people\\r\\n\\n\\nand would be nice to her. She is so lovely anybody ought to be proud as\\r\\n\\n\\na peacock to have her kin to the family. Now don\\'t you think we could\\r\\n\\n\\nfind out without her knowing? Then if they turned out to be no \\'count\\r\\n\\n\\npeople she need never know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We thought,\" put in Nan eagerly, \"as you are traveling about \\'hether\\r\\n\\n\\nand yen\\' as Landy says, you might come across some sort of--of--what\\r\\n\\n\\ndo you call it?--clue, without going out of your way.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney regarded her thoughtfully. \"I could do that. I should like\\r\\n\\n\\nto learn more. Do you know her mother\\'s maiden name?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mendez, I believe, wasn\\'t it, Mary Lee?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, it is her other name. She is Dolores Elvira Inez Mendez de\\r\\n\\n\\nGarcia. Inez is her saint\\'s name, St. Agnes, you know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t it an awfully long name?\" said Nan as Mr. Pinckney carefully\\r\\n\\n\\nwrote it down.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The thing to do,\" he said, \"is to find her baptismal record. If she\\r\\n\\n\\nwas the child of Elvira Mendez and an unknown American it may not\\r\\n\\n\\nbe difficult. I suppose you have no idea whether she was born in\\r\\n\\n\\nCalifornia or in Mexico.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I might find out,\" said Mary Lee. \"I think it was in Mexico. I will\\r\\n\\n\\ntry to get her to tell me just where it was. That would be a help,\\r\\n\\n\\nwouldn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Surely it would. Well, young ladies, I will try to prove myself an\\r\\n\\n\\nelderly fat knight errant and do service for your beautiful princess.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, thank you,\" they both cried. \"She is such a dear,\" sighed Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee. \"Don\\'t you think she is lovely, Mr. St. Nick?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She is a very sweet young lady, but rather quiet, isn\\'t she?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She can laugh real heartily,\" said Nan, \"and she laughs just like Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nRoberts.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney looked at her with a curious expression on his face. \"So\\r\\n\\n\\nshe does,\" he said. \"Strange I didn\\'t notice that.

What we want is something not too conspicuous, yet refined\\r\\n\\n\\nand artistic.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Chaste and elegant fills the bill,\" returned Carter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How would it do to dress up the four Corners as North, South, East and\\r\\n\\n\\nWest?\" suggested Mr. Pinckney. \"Dress North in fur and cover her with\\r\\n\\n\\nsnowballs; South could have magnolias; East could have,--could have----\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Could have----\" repeated Carter. \"Go on, Mr. St. Nick.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m stuck,\" he confessed. \"I don\\'t believe my ingenuity could devise\\r\\n\\n\\nsufficiently distinctive costumes.

I\\'d like right well to back up the old University and give her a\\r\\n\\n\\nchance. So far nothing better has been suggested. What is your scheme,\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Bobs? We haven\\'t heard from you yet.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I was thinking of proposing white flowers with a very little green\\r\\n\\n\\ndecoration. Green and white is always so fresh looking and is very\\r\\n\\n\\neffective if used right.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter looked dubious. \"Very effective for a wedding, maybe, but it\\r\\n\\n\\ndoesn\\'t appeal to me as striking enough.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Red and black, then.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The devil\\'s colors; oh, no, we are all too young and innocent,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nlaughed Carter. \"We\\'ll let Nan\\'s resolution lie on the table till\\r\\n\\n\\nto-morrow and in the meantime somebody else may come forward with a new\\r\\n\\n\\nsuggestion.\" So time went on until at last Miss Helen proposed that the\\r\\n\\n\\nwhite car be decked in yellow to represent the golden west and that\\r\\n\\n\\nits occupants wear white and yellow. This suggestion was unanimously\\r\\n\\n\\napproved but Miss Helen waived her right to a seat in the car and\\r\\n\\n\\nhanded it over to Nan who was ecstatic. Her own scheme of using the\\r\\n\\n\\ncolors of the University of Virginia had come second in favor so that\\r\\n\\n\\nit was considered proper that she should take Miss Helen\\'s place.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Nan is so slim there is plenty of room for another,\" said Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nwistfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So there is, kid,\" said Carter comfortingly. \"There\\'s plenty of room\\r\\n\\n\\nfor you and the other _trin_ on the back seat with Mary Lee, and Nan\\r\\n\\n\\ncan sit by me on the front seat if she doesn\\'t object.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNobody objected, Nan least of all, so this beautiful arrangement was\\r\\n\\n\\ncarried out, and yellow and gold filled their minds for the next few\\r\\n\\n\\ndays. The car was not to be entirely massed in flowers, but was to be\\r\\n\\n\\nbordered by the yellow blossoms, these outlining the top, sides and\\r\\n\\n\\nwheels, while the front was to be a solid yellow shield. Each lassie\\r\\n\\n\\nwas to carry a big bunch of yellow flowers and to wear white with a\\r\\n\\n\\nyellow sash. They were to have, too, crowns of yellow, and Carter in\\r\\n\\n\\nspeckless white would have a yellow necktie and wear a yellow flower in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis buttonhole.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We ought certainly to take the prize,\" said Nan. \"I don\\'t believe\\r\\n\\n\\nthere will be any prettier fix than ours.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, you country gal,\" cried Carter, \"a fix, indeed. What a way to\\r\\n\\n\\nspeak of my beautiful white car.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do we start from here, or do we go to Pasadena first and get things\\r\\n\\n\\nin order?\" asked Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You girls would better start from here,\" said Mrs. Roberts; \"you will\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a better chance to adorn yourselves, and Carter can meet you at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe hotel.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut Carter would none of this; he would not consent to starting on\\r\\n\\n\\nahead. \"Nine miles is nothing for an automobile,\" he said, \"and I\\'ll\\r\\n\\n\\nlet her go slow so the decorations will be in no danger of whizzing\\r\\n\\n\\noff. Besides, we\\'ll have a much better chance to get the car looking\\r\\n\\n\\nall right and note the effect.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney threw himself heart and soul into the fun. He posted off\\r\\n\\n\\nto Pasadena early to engage the \"place of vantage\" where the onlooking\\r\\n\\n\\nelders could be posted to see the parade, and where he could engage\\r\\n\\n\\na table for their dinner. It was all vastly exciting, the children\\r\\n\\n\\nthought. Jean rocked herself back and forth with delight as she sat on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe veranda floor watching Nan and Mary Lee make the crowns. \"Did you\\r\\n\\n\\never think we\\'d have such lovely story-book times,\" she said. \"I could\\r\\n\\n\\nscreal, I\\'m so happy.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t,\" returned Nan. \"Screaling is for scralid scraws, and\\r\\n\\n\\nscrirming screaky pigs with crirky tails, and not for little girls of\\r\\n\\n\\ncraulity.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Nan,\" protested Jean, \"you make such fun of me; do be criet.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So I will, if you will promise not to criver so with excitement,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nNan replied. \"Hand me those scissors, please. \\'She wore a wreath of', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

What an anachronism,\" said Carter. \"I\\'d\\r\\n\\n\\nhave to ride a horse and stow my car away in a garage, then where would\\r\\n\\n\\nyou be?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Sure enough, where? Looking at you on your curvetting steed instead of\\r\\n\\n\\nbeing looked at with you. I take it all back, Carter; I don\\'t wish you\\r\\n\\n\\nwere a caballero at all.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, my ladies, I\\'m perfectly satisfied with your appearance,\\r\\n\\n\\nindividually and collectively. Those little yellow coronets are just\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo sweet,\" he added in a finicking voice.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So is your tootsy-wootsy buttonhole bouquet,\" retorted Nan. \"Come,\\r\\n\\n\\nlet\\'s get in. Dispose your sashes, children, so they will show a little\\r\\n\\n\\nbit. That\\'s it. Now, I\\'ll seat myself. See if I\\'m all right, Carter.\\r\\n\\n\\nOh, I am so proud.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIndeed, so were they all. Never had there been a more excited set of\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren. To be part and parcel of a big parade, and such parade, was\\r\\n\\n\\nno common affair. It was a wonderful thing to share the plaudits of a\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat assemblage with gaily dressed ladies on coaches, with dashing\\r\\n\\n\\ncaballeros and brilliantly bedecked wheelmen. Jack could scarcely sit\\r\\n\\n\\nstill, and was constantly reprimanded by Mary Lee, who felt that the\\r\\n\\n\\ndignity of the party must be kept up by her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nTheir elders had gone on ahead and were comfortably placed in the seats\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney had procured for them. The whole town was gay with flags\\r\\n\\n\\nand banners; festoons of flowers graced the fronts of the houses;\\r\\n\\n\\narches of the same spanned the streets; all the shops and schools were\\r\\n\\n\\nclosed; tiers of seats held expectant spectators; Spanish cavaliers,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe descendants of the old residents of California, fell into line,\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir big sombreros garlanded with poppies or roses, their velvet\\r\\n\\n\\njackets showing brass buttons, silken cords and white puffs at elbows,\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir white trousers displaying bright color beneath the slashes. They\\r\\n\\n\\nwere the observed of all observers. Many of them wore sashes of flowers\\r\\n\\n\\nand the bridles of their horses were entwined with ribbons of the\\r\\n\\n\\nsame shade. A caballero mounted on a high-stepping black horse whose\\r\\n\\n\\ndecorations were yellow, made a fine showing, while the glossy white\\r\\n\\n\\nsteed which followed contrasted well with the brilliant red geraniums\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich adorned his master, and the horse himself seemed proud of his\\r\\n\\n\\nscarlet ribbons as he tossed his flowing mane and arched his neck.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThose at the windows and balconies noticed the happy faced party\\r\\n\\n\\nof little girls in their yellow and white, but in that mass of\\r\\n\\n\\ngorgeousness their car was not specially unique, but they did not\\r\\n\\n\\ncare, and scarcely one of them thought of the prize offered for the\\r\\n\\n\\nmost attractive decoration. Then there were automobiles a mass of\\r\\n\\n\\nroses, coaches of violets, whose occupants wore gowns of the same\\r\\n\\n\\nhue, victorias of lilies, every conceivable conceit wrought into the\\r\\n\\n\\nmoving pageant. Bicyclists in satin costumes of the picturesque period\\r\\n\\n\\nof Louis XV rode in solid line, their wheels adorned in harmony with\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir dress.

This might be the bridal procession and we might\\r\\n\\n\\nbe going from the church after the ceremony. He is a Spanish king, of\\r\\n\\n\\ncourse, because those are his courtiers on horseback.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust at this juncture the band struck up Dixie. Carter was on his feet\\r\\n\\n\\nin an instant waving his hat and shouting, \"Three cheers for the old\\r\\n\\n\\nDominion!\" The girls shrilled out their cheers and bystanders smiled at\\r\\n\\n\\nthe enthusiastic four whose example was followed by so many as to prove\\r\\n\\n\\nthat the land of Dixie had many representatives in that crowd.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nUp and down the parade passed in review, but at last it came to an\\r\\n\\n\\nend and the girls sought their friends at the hotel. \"Wasn\\'t it the\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandest thing you ever saw?\" cried Jack throwing herself on Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney, thus knocking to one side her coronet which was already awry.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he assured her, \"it was about as fine as anything I ever saw.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you sorry you weren\\'t in it?\" asked Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, no, to tell you the truth I am not, for I think we all saw much\\r\\n\\n\\nmore than you did.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t so much the seeing as the being,\" remarked Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And did you hear us cheer when they played Dixie?\" asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Hear you?\" said Mr. Pinckney laughing. \"I heard a mighty shout but I\\r\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t know it was you making all the noise.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Pasadena is such a beautiful place I don\\'t know why we didn\\'t come\\r\\n\\n\\nhere to live,\" said Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Sh!\" reproved Mary Lee. \"You know we stayed in Los Angeles because\\r\\n\\n\\nwe wanted to be near Mrs. Roberts and Mr. St. Nick, and I am sure it\\r\\n\\n\\ncouldn\\'t be lovelier anywhere than where we live.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Who is ready for the New Year\\'s dinner?\" asked Mr. Pinckney. \"Aren\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nyou all nearly starved?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I forgot about its being New Year,\" said Nan. \"It certainly isn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\na bit like any New Year we ever knew, but it is one I shall never\\r\\n\\n\\nforget.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Shall we wear our crowns to dinner?\" asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If you like,\" Mr. Pinckney told her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut the coronets being rather limp from wear, were taken off and the\\r\\n\\n\\nparty went down to the dining-room in the rest of their festal array.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhile a delicious dinner was served them they made merry over the\\r\\n\\n\\nfavors provided by Mr. Pinckney whose ingenuity in this direction\\r\\n\\n\\nbrought a great clapping of hands. For Carter there was a tiny\\r\\n\\n\\nautomobile, for Nan a little piano, for the señorita a guitar, for Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee a glass box of great California prunes, the many sided box top\\r\\n\\n\\nshowing the prismatic colors. Jack received a little toy kid, Jean an\\r\\n\\n\\nastronomical globe with the sign of the Gemini prominent.

She wondered where the child was. She had an\\r\\n\\n\\nindistinct recollection of hearing Jack announce that she meant to\\r\\n\\n\\ngo find the tomale man. They had discovered him the last time they\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been down town with Carter, and they had enjoyed the hot Mexican\\r\\n\\n\\npreparation so much that Jack declared she meant to go buy some\\r\\n\\n\\nherself some day. Could she have chosen to-day for the expedition into\\r\\n\\n\\nthe town?\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan made for the house. \"Where is Jack?\" she asked. No one knew. Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee had seen her talking to Li Hung. Jean had heard her say she was\\r\\n\\n\\ngoing somewhere and did not want any company. She would not tell where\\r\\n\\n\\nshe was going. The señorita had seen her counting over her store of\\r\\n\\n\\nnickels. Taking her clues from all this Nan started forth. \"It would\\r\\n\\n\\nnever do to let her go down town by herself,\" she said. \"She might get\\r\\n\\n\\nlost, but don\\'t worry mother about it; I\\'ll find her.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you telephone over to Mrs. Roberts,\" suggested Miss Helen;\\r\\n\\n\\n\"she may have gone there.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan called up, but no Jack had been there that morning. Garden, orchard\\r\\n\\n\\nand the surrounding streets were searched and all finally arrived at\\r\\n\\n\\nNan\\'s conclusion, so she started for the centre of the town where\\r\\n\\n\\nthey had come across the tomale man. There he was with his corn husk\\r\\n\\n\\npackages neatly tied and filled with the delectable preparation so\\r\\n\\n\\ndear to the hearts of the Mexican. There was no Jack in sight as\\r\\n\\n\\nNan came up. She wandered up and down trying to discover her sister\\r\\n\\n\\nand suddenly found herself in the midst of a queer street where she\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed to be transported to the other side of the globe. Here were\\r\\n\\n\\nshops innumerable displaying such strange wares that Nan stood still\\r\\n\\n\\nto wonder before she turned to flee. She was not timid, but to be\\r\\n\\n\\nsurrounded by plodding Chinamen stubbing along in their queer shoes\\r\\n\\n\\nmade her feel uncomfortable. One or two turned slanting eyes upon her\\r\\n\\n\\nbut most passed her unconcernedly. Before a shop gay with banners and\\r\\n\\n\\npainted signs Nan paused, but in the masses of unknown objects which\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could see by peering inside there was nothing that she recognized,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she went on passing all sorts of establishments, before which were\\r\\n\\n\\nset forth such wares as platters of fish, bunches of herbs and tubs of\\r\\n\\n\\nvegetables the like of which she had never seen before.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe would like to have penetrated further, to have stopped to look in\\r\\n\\n\\nat the Chinamen eating with chop sticks, and the Chinese women with\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch curiously arranged hair, but she scarcely dared, and satisfied\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Jack had not strayed this way she retraced her steps and was once\\r\\n\\n\\nagain out of China and in America. The tomale man still hawked his\\r\\n\\n\\nwares and the crowds were still hurrying to and fro, an interesting\\r\\n\\n\\ncrowd, Nan thought, for so many nationalities were represented, but\\r\\n\\n\\namong them was no little bright-eyed girl answering to the name of Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I might as well hunt for a needle in a hay-stack,\" thought Nan. \"I\\'d\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter go back home for probably she is there by this time.

I\\'ve got you now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan set out on a quick run. Surely this was Jack. She came up just in\\r\\n\\n\\ntime to see the boy tweak off Jack\\'s hat and throw it on the ground,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut she also saw why he did not advance further, for whichever way he\\r\\n\\n\\nturned the steely point of a long sharp hat pin confronted him. Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nhad chosen her own weapon and never had ventured from home without it\\r\\n\\n\\nsince the day of her battle with the boy. _The Boy_ she called him in\\r\\n\\n\\nher own mind. She had felt that this hour might come some day, but it\\r\\n\\n\\nnever kept her within the limits of security. One might think that\\r\\n\\n\\nit would have been a small thing for a little boy to worst a girl\\r\\n\\n\\nof his own size, and so it might if fists were all that were to be\\r\\n\\n\\nconsidered; hat pins put a different face upon the affair. So though\\r\\n\\n\\nJack was merely on the defensive, defend herself she could, and very\\r\\n\\n\\nably.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Jack Corner,\" cried Nan, \"what are you up to?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack was off her guard for a second, but the boy seeing that\\r\\n\\n\\nreinforcements had arrived, did not dare to make further attack. \"Pick\\r\\n\\n\\nup my hat, won\\'t you, Nan?\" said Jack coolly, \"and won\\'t you get the\\r\\n\\n\\ntomales from behind me? I\\'m afraid I\\'ll step on them. You\\'d better go\\r\\n\\n\\nhome, boy,\" she remarked with a mocking laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, you\\'d better go,\" said Nan. \"What do you mean by teasing my\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle sister?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t she done enough to make me tease her?\" said the boy sullenly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Ain\\'t she nearly beat the life out of me?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So you\\'re the boy, are you?\" Nan looked at him interestedly. \"Well, I\\r\\n\\n\\ncan tell you that it won\\'t be good for you to stay around here. There\\r\\n\\n\\nare too many of us to look after this little girl. Our Chinaman keeps\\r\\n\\n\\na tub of scalding water ready for you if he catches you, and if you\\r\\n\\n\\ntry to run away Mr. Barnwell has his automobile always on hand, and if\\r\\n\\n\\nthat isn\\'t enough I can easily call up a policeman. I won\\'t answer for\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat the Chinaman will do if he once gets hold of you. They can do\\r\\n\\n\\nhorrible things, you know. He may be on the lookout now.\" Nan peeped\\r\\n\\n\\nover the hedge as if to discover the lurking Li Hung. Her threats and\\r\\n\\n\\nsuggestions of dark things had their effect, for the boy backed off,\\r\\n\\n\\nkeeping his eye on the hat pin which Jack still pointed at him, and\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen at a safe distance he turned and fled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The next time, Jack,\" said Nan, \"he\\'ll not come alone, I can promise\\r\\n\\n\\nyou that. Now, young lady, why did you abscond this way without leave?\\r\\n\\n\\nYou know mother doesn\\'t allow it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s why I went,\" said Jack. \"I was afraid she wouldn\\'t let me go if\\r\\n\\n\\nI asked her, and I wasn\\'t disobeying if she didn\\'t say I couldn\\'t, was\\r\\n\\n\\nI?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, in a way you weren\\'t. Give an account of yourself. Where have\\r\\n\\n\\nyou been?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To get some tomales from the Chili wagon. I brought you one, Nan, and\\r\\n\\n\\none to the señorita.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How do you know we\\'ll like them?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re sure to. If you don\\'t care for yours you can give it to\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee; she\\'ll eat it whether she likes it or not because it is\\r\\n\\n\\nSpanish and because the señorita likes it. They have all sorts of\\r\\n\\n\\nthings in them, funny things, the man told me; chicken and olives, and\\r\\n\\n\\never so many queer names I can\\'t remember. He could speak English, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was very nice and polite.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That may be, but you ought to have been at home playing quietly like a\\r\\n\\n\\nnice well-behaved little girl.

I thought you might have gone off somewhere by yourself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What made you think so?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I heard you say you were going after tomales some day.

She was not the only human being in the wilderness then. At first\\r\\n\\n\\nshe decided not to venture from her place, but after half an hour had\\r\\n\\n\\npassed she became a little lonely and the idea of human companionship\\r\\n\\n\\nseemed rather pleasant to contemplate. The bees, in their busy\\r\\n\\n\\ngathering of honey, droned so sleepily that they offered no excitement,\\r\\n\\n\\nalthough at first it had been interesting to watch them. Mary Lee\\r\\n\\n\\nloved all animals and would have tried to make friends with any who\\r\\n\\n\\nmight have appeared, but beyond the friskings of an agile squirrel once\\r\\n\\n\\nin a while she had not seen any.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter some hesitation, as the steady chopping kept on, she arose from\\r\\n\\n\\nher seat and cautiously made her way toward the spot from whence the\\r\\n\\n\\nnoise came. After a time she saw a man who was bringing his axe down\\r\\n\\n\\nwith mighty strokes and who was too intent upon his work to notice the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle figure so near till a voice by his side said: \"That\\'s a mighty\\r\\n\\n\\nbig tree you\\'re cutting down.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Great fathers!\" cried the man dropping his axe and looking at the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle girl. \"Where under the sun did you come from?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"From just over yonder,\" replied Mary Lee. \"The others have gone\\r\\n\\n\\nfurther up the mountain, but I wanted to rest and so I am waiting for\\r\\n\\n\\nthem to come back. They will be here presently. I hoped I would see a\\r\\n\\n\\nDouglas squirrel, but I didn\\'t. Did you ever see a water ousel? I have\\r\\n\\n\\nread about them and I would give anything to see one.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man smiled. \"Well, yes,\" he answered, \"they\\'re plenty around the\\r\\n\\n\\nstreams and as to Douglas squirrels they\\'ve been capering about here\\r\\n\\n\\nall morning. They\\'re about the liveliest creeturs ever I did see. You\\r\\n\\n\\nkeep still a minute and maybe you\\'ll get to see one. Aha, I thought\\r\\n\\n\\nso,\" for presently to Mary Lee\\'s delight she saw the quick motions that\\r\\n\\n\\nindicated a presence in a tree just beyond where she was standing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Most folks out here call him a Pine squirrel,\" said the man. \"This\\r\\n\\n\\none\\'s been a barkin\\' at me on and off all the morning. Hear him now:\\r\\n\\n\\nPee-ah! Pee-ah! that\\'s him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee listened and presently the little creature came nearer and\\r\\n\\n\\nnearer, this time angry at seeing a new intruder whose language he did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot know, and as he made a sudden dash at the two humans, Mary Lee\\r\\n\\n\\ncould see him distinctly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He is a lively one,\" the man remarked again. \"Now, if you want to see\\r\\n\\n\\none of them water thrushes I guess we can find one if you don\\'t mind a\\r\\n\\n\\nrough little walk.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee had no misgivings as she followed her guide and he, in return\\r\\n\\n\\nfor her confidence, entertained her to the best of his ability. \"How\\r\\n\\n\\ndid you happen to know about these critturs?\" he asked. \"You ain\\'t from\\r\\n\\n\\nthese mountain parts, I know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" returned Mary Lee, \"I am from the East, from Virginia, but my\\r\\n\\n\\naunt has been reading to us about the birds and beasts of California\\r\\n\\n\\nand those two I have been very anxious to see. We have been looking for\\r\\n\\n\\nthem, and I am glad I shall have seen them first.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Them squirrels is the out-beatingest critturs for not scaring,\" the\\r\\n\\n\\nman told her, \"and they cut up more didos.

I was\\r\\n\\n\\nbrought up on the coast and I figgered around this region up and down\\r\\n\\n\\nsince I was a boy. Sometimes it ain\\'t been healthy for me to stay in\\r\\n\\n\\none place and I\\'ve lit out to another.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, doesn\\'t the climate of California agree with everybody?\" asked\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee guilelessly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man laughed and shook his head. \"Depends on what your complaint is.\\r\\n\\n\\nNow my complaint always happened to be somebody else\\'s complaint and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat\\'s what made it bad for my health at times.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee pondered some time upon this unintelligible speech, indeed\\r\\n\\n\\nuntil the waterfall was reached where the glad presence of the water\\r\\n\\n\\nousel put all else out of her thoughts. There he was to be sure,\\r\\n\\n\\nflitting, diving, whirling in the eddying pools, poising like a\\r\\n\\n\\nhumming-bird above the cascade, and singing, ever singing. Oh, the\\r\\n\\n\\njoy of it! Mary Lee stood enraptured. Once she turned a beamingly\\r\\n\\n\\nappreciative face upon the rough man at her side.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Like him, do ye?\" he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I love him; I adore him,\" returned Mary Lee bending a little forward\\r\\n\\n\\nto see the better. Only a small bluish-gray bird with a touch of brown\\r\\n\\n\\nupon him, but he was the very spirit of the waterfall, a sprite--a\\r\\n\\n\\nwater-baby. \"Do you suppose he will still be here when the others get\\r\\n\\n\\nback?\" asked Mary Lee. \"I\\'d so love them to see him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He may be,\" returned the man, then in an undertone, \"but I won\\'t.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I certainly am obliged to you for showing me the two things I wanted\\r\\n\\n\\nmost to see,\" said Mary Lee as they wended their way back to the\\r\\n\\n\\nwood-chopper\\'s tree. \"I should think your children would be very glad\\r\\n\\n\\nto have a father who could show them so many woodsy creatures. Have you\\r\\n\\n\\nany little girls?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man was silent for a moment. \"I don\\'t know whether I have or not,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said presently.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" Mary Lee looked surprised. \"Why not?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, you see the way of it was this. It\\'s twenty-odd year since I\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried my wife. She was a Mexican girl, pretty as a picture. Her folks\\r\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t cotton to me and circumstances was against me so I lit out not\\r\\n\\n\\nlong after we was married, and next thing I hear my girl is dead, and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe message I got from her father didn\\'t make it look wise for me to\\r\\n\\n\\ngo back and claim the baby. Besides, what would I do with a youngster,\\r\\n\\n\\nliving wild like I had to? She was better off, I figgered it out, than\\r\\n\\n\\nshe would be with her father, so I left her be, and though I ain\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nforgot her, I don\\'t ever mean she shall know she has a daddy. I ain\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nnothin\\' to be proud of, missy, though once I was a right likely sort\\r\\n\\n\\nof buck. Well, so long. I guess we must part here. I hear your folks\\r\\n\\n\\nhollerin\\' to you.

It was perfectly glorious. We saw acres and acres of flowers,\\r\\n\\n\\nsuch great thistles you never saw. Carter measured one that was two\\r\\n\\n\\nfeet around and an alder bush was a real tree. We saw a water ousel,\\r\\n\\n\\ntoo.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And a Douglas squirrel,\" Mary Lee put in, \"at least I did.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And the mountains are wonderful, the cañons so dark and deep\\r\\n\\n\\nsometimes, but I was afraid I would fall when we came down those\\r\\n\\n\\nnarrow, narrow mountain paths,\" Nan was the speaker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And once,\" Mary Lee added, \"I got off and waited for the rest, because\\r\\n\\n\\nmy burro behaved so badly I was afraid he would do something dreadful.\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter rode him home and I took his, which was not near so mean.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, there was lots to see,\" Nan went on, \"so much besides the\\r\\n\\n\\nmountains and the towns and the orange groves. There are ever so many\\r\\n\\n\\nsprings up that way, all kinds; some one told us there were a thousand\\r\\n\\n\\nhot springs in that part of California. We went to one of them. Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen would like to have gone to the Pala Mission where there are so\\r\\n\\n\\nmany Indians but she thought she\\'d make another trip there in a less\\r\\n\\n\\nroundabout way. I hope she\\'ll take us.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it was a great experience, wasn\\'t it?\" said Mr. Pinckney. \"But\\r\\n\\n\\nI\\'m glad to see your cheerful countenances again, although the twinnies\\r\\n\\n\\nhave kept us from being too lonely.

It isn\\'t so hard to do without a thing when you\\r\\n\\n\\nhaven\\'t had it, you see.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girls looked at each other. \"We would like so much to get a\\r\\n\\n\\ngranddaughter for you,\" said Nan, \"and if we were not all so fond of\\r\\n\\n\\none another you could have one of us, but we would be wicked to leave\\r\\n\\n\\nmother.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see anything but to keep you out here,\" replied Mr. Pinckney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If the climate helps your mother why shouldn\\'t you stay?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we\\'d like it,\" said Nan, \"but I don\\'t believe mother and Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen would want to stay forever.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to suit everybody, isn\\'t it?\" said Mr. Pinckney. \"I suppose\\r\\n\\n\\nthe day will come when I shall want to go East again myself. Well, we\\r\\n\\n\\nwon\\'t bother about it yet awhile.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We could keep the señorita if we stayed here,\" said Mary Lee\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughtfully. \"She would rather not go East if she can get a good\\r\\n\\n\\nposition out here.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So there\\'s a heavy balance on that side,\" said Mr. Pinckney. \"I know\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich way you would vote.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Speaking of the señorita, we want to tell you something,\" said Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mary Lee met a queer man up in the mountains and we think he may\\r\\n\\n\\npossibly be the señorita\\'s father.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, I thought her father was not living.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So did we, but I\\'ll tell you why we think maybe he is alive.\" And Nan\\r\\n\\n\\ndisclosed the theory which she and Mary Lee had worked up, Mr. Pinckney\\r\\n\\n\\nan interested listener. \"Now what do you think of it?\" asked Nan in\\r\\n\\n\\nconclusion.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is possible, of course, but we must be sure first that her father\\r\\n\\n\\nis really dead.

I never did go to\\r\\n\\n\\none, even a little one. Some of the schoolgirls have little afternoon\\r\\n\\n\\nsomethings, but they are not really dress-up affairs. Won\\'t the\\r\\n\\n\\ntwinnies be delighted? I hope Jack will keep her hair ribbon tied and\\r\\n\\n\\nthat she won\\'t spill anything.

I just wish we could always have\\r\\n\\n\\nyou this near to us. But dear me, Mary Lee, we must go. We told mother\\r\\n\\n\\nwe wouldn\\'t stay long, and it is most dinner time. No, Mrs. Bobs, we\\r\\n\\n\\nreally can\\'t stay this time, thank you. Does mother know about the tea?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but I asked her to let me have the pleasure of telling you about\\r\\n\\n\\nit.

He was very kind and\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerous to her while her aunt lived and she feels that she had no\\r\\n\\n\\nclaim on him even then, and now that he needs the money she is trying\\r\\n\\n\\nto pay it.

Mother is so clever about cutting\\r\\n\\n\\nand fitting and the señorita sews beautifully, then she has lovely lace\\r\\n\\n\\nso it will not need much trimming. I am sure it can be made here at\\r\\n\\n\\nhome. We\\'ll risk it anyway.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt did not take them long to carry out their plan. They started out in\\r\\n\\n\\ngreat excitement that same afternoon. \"We may not be back to supper,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nthey called as they left the veranda. \"If Mrs. Roberts asks us to stay\\r\\n\\n\\nwe shall, if you don\\'t mind, mother. You\\'ll know where we are.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Very well,\" she returned, \"but don\\'t stay too late.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That was managed beautifully,\" said Mary Lee, giving Nan\\'s arm a\\r\\n\\n\\nsqueeze. \"Miss Dolores will never suspect. Now we must go down street\\r\\n\\n\\nand take the car at the next corner; in that way we can put them off\\r\\n\\n\\nthe track.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Not the cars, I hope,\" returned Nan flippantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, silly, the family. Nan, a dreadful thought has taken possession of\\r\\n\\n\\nme. Mother will wonder what we have done with our money. Shall we tell\\r\\n\\n\\nher?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Not till after the tea; we can then. Our Christmas money is ours to do\\r\\n\\n\\nexactly what we please with and she will not care. Mother can keep a\\r\\n\\n\\nsecret better than anybody in the world and of course she will have to\\r\\n\\n\\nknow. I should want her to.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So should I, but it will be better not at first.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThere was much picking and choosing of the proper fabric, much\\r\\n\\n\\nsmothered laughter at the Chinese shopkeeper\\'s pigeon English, much\\r\\n\\n\\nsatisfaction as the parcel was borne away. It was first carried to\\r\\n\\n\\nanother shop where a sheet of clean white paper was purchased; in this\\r\\n\\n\\nit was wrapped, and the address written by the accommodating clerk, so\\r\\n\\n\\nthat not the slightest clue should be given to the place where it was\\r\\n\\n\\noriginally bought. Then it was given into the hands of a messenger and\\r\\n\\n\\nthe two girls in a happy frame of mind took their way to Mrs. Roberts\\'.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d give anything to see her when she gets it,\" said Nan. \"I wonder if\\r\\n\\n\\nshe will be mad, Mary Lee?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I hope not. She will be mystified allee samee.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She will that.

As the soft crêpy\\r\\n\\n\\nfolds slipped through her fingers she had a girl\\'s natural longing for\\r\\n\\n\\nthe silken stuff, but this was but momentary, and was swept away by\\r\\n\\n\\nher stronger feeling of indignant pride.

Please explain.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Some one has sent me mater-rial--stoff--which I cannot buy.

She is aware of your wishes and would not have\\r\\n\\n\\ndone this.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then who? Who? I beg your pardon, Señorita Helen. I am sorree. I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould not have suspected and charged you.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, never mind, so long as I am not the guilty one,\" said Miss Helen\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiling. \"How did it come?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I know not. I found it upon the table addressed in a strange writing,\\r\\n\\n\\nno card, no name of shop, no anything.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then it is a mystery. I don\\'t see anything for you to do but to keep\\r\\n\\n\\nit. You can\\'t send it back when you don\\'t know where it came from.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I cannot, but I will find the giver and I will spur-r-n it!\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen smiled, though the señorita did not see. Her pride was so\\r\\n\\n\\ntouched that she could not understand that any one should think her\\r\\n\\n\\nheroics a little exaggerated. \"It could not be Mrs. R-R-ob-erts,\" she\\r\\n\\n\\npresently rolled out. \"She would not dar-r-e.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, indeed, I am sure it was not.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Nor--Mr. Pinckney?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is more like the kind of thing he likes to do, but still I do not\\r\\n\\n\\nthink we can suspect him in this case, for you know, my dear, no one\\r\\n\\n\\nbut your own family, here in the house, knows the reason you had for\\r\\n\\n\\ndeclining Mrs. Roberts\\' invitation. She does not even know yet that you\\r\\n\\n\\nthink of positively declining it. There would be absolutely no excuse\\r\\n\\n\\nfor Mr. Pinckney to send it, you see.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe señorita sighed. Her little rage was passing away since there was\\r\\n\\n\\nno one to accuse. She shook her head. \"Then I know not who. Could it\\r\\n\\n\\nbe my uncle?\" she said suddenly, her face lighting up. \"Perhaps he\\r\\n\\n\\nhas thought to do this knowing I am sending his family more----\" She\\r\\n\\n\\npaused, startled at her speech. \"What have I said?\" she murmured.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said Miss Helen soothingly. \"I shall not remember.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe señorita seized her hands and kissed them. \"You are so good, so\\r\\n\\n\\npatient.

Now, don\\'t worry any more about the giver.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhoever it was, I can assure you it was none of us nor the Robertses.\\r\\n\\n\\nNow, be happy about it like any other girl.\" She stooped and kissed the\\r\\n\\n\\nseñorita\\'s bright hair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I will be happy,\" said the girl springing up. \"You do not know how I', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

Am I not lucky?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girls looked at each other and Nan giggled outright, for Mary Lee\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nface wore such an amazed expression. It was all very well not to let\\r\\n\\n\\nyour right hand know what your left one was doing but Mary Lee was\\r\\n\\n\\nnot sure that she liked Mr. Arnaldo Garcia to have the credit of her\\r\\n\\n\\nsacrifice. If the giver had simply remained an indefinite, intangible\\r\\n\\n\\nsomebody it would have been all right, but to have her money and Nan\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nplaced in Señor Garcia\\'s pocketbook, so to speak, was a little too\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch. Still she could say nothing and was really happy over the delight\\r\\n\\n\\nof her beloved Miss Dolores.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And it comes something so mysterious,\" said the señorita. \"I think it\\r\\n\\n\\nis your aunt, your mother, who send, and I am in a rage, fury, but your\\r\\n\\n\\nso sensible aunt shows me my error and now I am content.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She would have been in just as much of a rage and fury if she had\\r\\n\\n\\nknown we sent it,\" said Nan as the señorita left them. \"It is kind\\r\\n\\n\\nof hard on us, Mary Lee, to have Señor Garcia spending our Christmas\\r\\n\\n\\nmoney, but I reckon we\\'ll have to grin and bear it, for if she had an\\r\\n\\n\\ninkling of the truth there would be no white crêpe gown made up for\\r\\n\\n\\nthat tea, I can promise you. Mother will tell us that it was a good\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscipline for our characters.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so she did, for though she laughed at Mary Lee\\'s lugubrious\\r\\n\\n\\nexpression when she told of how her Christmas money had been spent,\\r\\n\\n\\nshe said: \"Well, my dear, it is your own doing. You wanted it a secret\\r\\n\\n\\nand a secret it must be. I\\'ll never tell, you may be sure, and after\\r\\n\\n\\nall, I think it is well for us to perform an act merely for the good\\r\\n\\n\\nthat it does and not for any recognition we may get for it. That is\\r\\n\\n\\ntrue generosity, simon-pure variety. Never mind if Mr. Garcia did seem\\r\\n\\n\\nto give the gown you will enjoy the señorita\\'s pleasure in it, and she\\r\\n\\n\\nwill enjoy it twice as much, while I shall take delight in helping her\\r\\n\\n\\nto make it up, a double delight, since I know my darling girls gave it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We meant not to tell you till after the tea,\" said Nan, \"but we just\\r\\n\\n\\ncouldn\\'t keep it, for we were so taken aback when we found out that\\r\\n\\n\\nSeñor Garcia had been spending our pocket money.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner laughed. \"I am glad you didn\\'t wait to tell me.

The soft white, clinging folds\\r\\n\\n\\nheightened her slender figure and gave it a grace which her ordinary\\r\\n\\n\\nplain black frocks did not reveal.

It looks like fairyland,\" said Nan as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe stepped into the house the afternoon of the tea. From behind a\\r\\n\\n\\nscreen of roses issued soft music played by an unseen orchestra. All\\r\\n\\n\\nup the stairway stood pots of graceful palms, the balustrades were\\r\\n\\n\\ngarlanded, the dining-room was a bower, the veranda a place beautiful.\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney was the presiding genius of the occasion, his beaming face\\r\\n\\n\\nappearing as a welcome as soon as the Corners arrived.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"My! What angels are these?\" he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"They are the ones who belong to this Paradise,\" said Nan quickly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do we look nice, Mr. St. Nick?\" asked Jean. \"Do you think my frock is\\r\\n\\n\\npretty? I have worn it only once before and I have on silk stockings.\\r\\n\\n\\nDo you want to see them?\" She held out a silken clad foot. \"We are all\\r\\n\\n\\nwearing our very nicest things that came from Europe. We think mother\\r\\n\\n\\nis perfectly lovely, but Mary Lee won\\'t say she looks prettier than the\\r\\n\\n\\nseñorita.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What are we to do, Mrs. Bobs?\" Jack asked eagerly.

I am sure Master Clarence Opdyke is greatly\\r\\n\\n\\nstruck.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what he was the first time he met Jack,\" said Nan laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Nan, what a pun,\" groaned Carter. \"It is unworthy of a girl of\\r\\n\\n\\nyour brilliant intellect. Say, have you had any of those delectable\\r\\n\\n\\neatings in there, or have you been so busy feeding the animals that you\\r\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t get a chance to slide anything into your own mouth?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m waiting till every one goes when we are to have our fill.\\r\\n\\n\\nYou\\'d better wait till then, too.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So I intend to do; I shall get much more thereby.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Greedy. Doesn\\'t the señorita look lovely?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but your mother beats the bunch; she\\'s a daisy in that frock.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I think,\" said Nan emphatically with a fond look toward\\r\\n\\n\\nthe open door through which could be seen the receiving party.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Miss Helen is a close second,\" said Carter with a glance at the\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle figure with white hair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, she is a darling, too,\" returned Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter laughed. \"That\\'s one of the things I like about you all; you\\'re\\r\\n\\n\\nso awfully fond of one another and aren\\'t ashamed to show it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why should we be?\" Nan\\'s eyes had wandered to where Jack sat. \"She is\\r\\n\\n\\na little rapscallion to go off and leave the salted almonds to take\\r\\n\\n\\ncare of themselves. That\\'s just like Jack; she is so eager to help\\r\\n\\n\\nalways, but she doesn\\'t stick to things. I\\'m afraid,\" continued the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl, \"I am a little that way myself, though I am trying to get more\\r\\n\\n\\nstickable. Aunt Helen says that is where girls so often fail. She says\\r\\n\\n\\nthey need concentration and that is why she thinks college is good for\\r\\n\\n\\nthem. I hate mathematics yet Aunt Helen says I ought to study them\\r\\n\\n\\nparticularly just because I don\\'t like to.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"For my part I never find them much of a grind,\" said Carter. \"Look at\\r\\n\\n\\nthose youngsters now; you would suppose they were little turtle doves,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nfor the two children, hand in hand, were wandering down the garden walk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that I approve of the new friendship,\" said Nan. \"I\\r\\n\\n\\nthought he was a perfectly horrid little boy when I saw him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So did I. He\\'s a spoiled one, I fancy, none too well brought up, full\\r\\n\\n\\nof mischief and allowed to run wild.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I wonder what sort of looking woman his mother is,\" remarked Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think I\\'ll try to find out. Most of the people have gone, but she\\r\\n\\n\\nmust still be here or Clarence--what a name--would be gone, too.\" She\\r\\n\\n\\nstepped down into the garden and came up to Jack who was showing off\\r\\n\\n\\nthe beauties of the place with an air of proprietorship.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been here before,\" said Clarence sturdily.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but I come \\'most every day,\" returned Jack, \"and I know where\\r\\n\\n\\neverything grows.

Is she tall or short, fat or thin?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why I don\\'t know; she\\'s just a woman, you know.\" Clarence\\'s ideas were\\r\\n\\n\\nrather hazy in matters of description.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I see,\" returned Nan. \"Well, I will leave you now. Jack, don\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\ntear your frock and don\\'t go too far from the house; we are going to\\r\\n\\n\\nhave our tea directly.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I got a man to give Clarence some cake and ice-cream and things,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Jack, \"and then we came out here, but I haven\\'t had any. Come on,\\r\\n\\n\\nClarence, let\\'s go in; maybe you can have some more if there is enough.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nClarence thus cajoled, followed willingly. \"Show me which is your\\r\\n\\n\\nmother,\" said Nan to him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"She\\'s over there,\" Clarence told her; \"the one with a feather in her\\r\\n\\n\\nhat talking to the old lady.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan nodded. \"I see. All right, you stay here so she\\'ll know where to\\r\\n\\n\\nfind you.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Opdyke, over-dressed, voluble, and full of theories was just the\\r\\n\\n\\nkind of woman whose affairs abroad compelled neglect at home. Clarence\\r\\n\\n\\nran wild while she went from club to meeting, from meeting to tea,\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom tea to club again. Her voice was always ready to argue, to set\\r\\n\\n\\nforth opinions, to state conditions. She was a star member of the\\r\\n\\n\\nmany organizations to which she belonged, but the less said about the\\r\\n\\n\\nfulfilment of her duties as mother the better. It was because of this\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Mrs. Roberts thought it would be a good thing to throw Clarence\\r\\n\\n\\ninto the society of four nice little girls. Of his passage at arms\\r\\n\\n\\nwith Jack she knew nothing, and it was Carter who finally told her of\\r\\n\\n\\nit. This was after all had departed and the tired ladies were enjoying\\r\\n\\n\\na peaceful hour. The girls were being served with their share of the\\r\\n\\n\\ndainties at a small table at which Mr. Pinckney jovially presided and\\r\\n\\n\\nthey were having a royal time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Opdyke is a most interesting woman,\" said Mrs. Roberts, \"and\\r\\n\\n\\nClarence is a bright boy, but full of mischief. His spirits must have\\r\\n\\n\\nsome outlet and as his mother has not the time to direct his amusements\\r\\n\\n\\nhe does all manner of things he should not. This chance meeting to-day\\r\\n\\n\\nis certainly a funny sequel to that first conflict.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t like the little rat when I first saw him,\" said Carter, \"and\\r\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure now that I wouldn\\'t like to take him out and give him a\\r\\n\\n\\ngood thrashing. He needs a healthy system of discipline.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Poor little chap,\" said Miss Helen commiseratingly. \"What we ought\\r\\n\\n\\nto do, Carter, is to teach him how he ought to behave.

Give a youngster like Clarence plenty of good healthy interests\\r\\n\\n\\nand he will not get into mischief.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not so sure that he is a subject for reform,\" said Carter with the\\r\\n\\n\\nintolerance of youth. \"He will have to improve his views of how a girl\\r\\n\\n\\nshould be treated before he gets any consideration from me.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What could you expect,\" said Mrs. Corner, \"when Jack did not act like\\r\\n\\n\\na girl? She did not command courtly attention, I am sure.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter laughed. \"Well, perhaps not, but he will have his eyes opened\\r\\n\\n\\nbefore I am through with him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut indeed Jack, in the character of a dainty, fairylike creature, all\\r\\n\\n\\nfluffy frock, silkened sash and slippered feet, was quite a different\\r\\n\\n\\nperson from the little scratch-cat who had flown at Clarence as Li\\r\\n\\n\\nHung\\'s avenger, and after being borne away with reluctant feet from the\\r\\n\\n\\ntea, he could not be persuaded to remain, but was back again at the\\r\\n\\n\\nRoberts\\' gate, a wistful figure, as soon as his mother\\'s absence from\\r\\n\\n\\nhome gave him an excuse to escape, and when Jack graciously invited him\\r\\n\\n\\nin he was her shadow until the time came for her departure.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThereafter every afternoon saw him hanging around the entrance to the\\r\\n\\n\\nCorners\\' garden waiting for Jack to appear. Nan called him the tame\\r\\n\\n\\nbear and nicknamed him Teddy. Carter pretended to be jealous and said\\r\\n\\n\\nthat Clarence had cut him out, while Mrs. Corner watched carefully\\r\\n\\n\\nto see whether the benefit to Clarence outweighed the possible\\r\\n\\n\\ndisadvantage to her own children. But since there were four girls to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe one boy and each was a self-appointed mentor the advantage to\\r\\n\\n\\nClarence at last began to tell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re making a real nice boy of him,\" Jean said complacently. \"He\\r\\n\\n\\ndoesn\\'t say Gol darn any more and he doesn\\'t pull off the flies\\' legs\\r\\n\\n\\nand wings like he used to, \\'cause Jack and I showed him how it felt. We\\r\\n\\n\\nwere going to tie his hair to the hedge like he did Li Hung\\'s but it\\r\\n\\n\\nwasn\\'t long enough. He said we were screamish when we began to crarrel\\r\\n\\n\\nwith him about the flies.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do you mean you screamed?\" said Carter, to whom the remark was\\r\\n\\n\\naddressed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No of course not,\" said Jack; \"she means squeamish. Aren\\'t you used to\\r\\n\\n\\nher way of talking yet? You ought to be by this time.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am very stupid,\" said Carter meekly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I told him if he didn\\'t say Gol darn or Gosh gorm for a week, I\\'d\\r\\n\\n\\nask you to take him next time we go out in the automobile,\" said Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowing up her advantage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Carter, \"that\\'s a straw too much. When you have deserted me\\r\\n\\n\\nfor a little unlicked cub like that and I get you away from him only by\\r\\n\\n\\ninviting you to ride you want him to go along, too. I protest.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but it will only be once,\" said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I know how much it will. Give him an inch and he\\'ll take an ell.\\r\\n\\n\\nNext thing you will be refusing to go with me at all unless he is\\r\\n\\n\\ninvited, too, you\\'re getting so thick with him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, I\\'ll not,\" persisted Jack. \"I\\'ll never ask but once. He has never\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen in an automobile and you see it\\'s the only way to keep him from\\r\\n\\n\\nsaying those horrid words. He says he\\'ll have to say something, so I\\r\\n\\n\\ntold him he could say, Dog it all; that doesn\\'t sound so bad as the\\r\\n\\n\\nothers. You can\\'t really dog anything, can you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He dogs your footsteps,\" returned Carter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack looked at him speculatively, and thought over this statement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" she said finally, \"it isn\\'t a very bad thing even if you can do\\r\\n\\n\\nit, so I reckon it is the best thing he can say after all. Will you let\\r\\n\\n\\nhim go, Carter?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I will upon one condition.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That you will sign a paper which promises that you will never ask', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

I\\'ll prepare it now.\" He gravely wrote out a formal\\r\\n\\n\\ndocument which he read impressively to Jack who signed her name to it\\r\\n\\n\\nin very black uneven letters, and Carter professed himself satisfied.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe very next day Clarence had the bliss of taking his first ride in\\r\\n\\n\\na motor car during which time he proved himself so entertaining that\\r\\n\\n\\nthe following afternoon Jack and Jean were amazed to see Carter\\'s car\\r\\n\\n\\nwhiz by with Clarence again as passenger. He waved his cap exultantly\\r\\n\\n\\nand Jack experienced a real feeling of jealousy. If Clarence had been\\r\\n\\n\\nusurping Carter\\'s place in her affections now the tables were turned\\r\\n\\n\\nand the little boy was now superseding her in Carter\\'s affections.\\r\\n\\n\\nJack did not like it a bit and Carter could have taken no surer way of\\r\\n\\n\\nsending Clarence into the background, for never again did Jack so much\\r\\n\\n\\nas hint that Clarence would like a ride.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor two whole days she turned her back on the pair of them, and\\r\\n\\n\\noccupied herself with playing dolls with Jean in a sequestered\\r\\n\\n\\ncorner of the garden never appearing in spite of Carter\\'s whistle or\\r\\n\\n\\nClarence\\'s call.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                             AT THE RANCH\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean was laid up with a sprained ankle which she twisted in trying to\\r\\n\\n\\nfollow where Jack and Clarence led to the upper branches of a tree in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe garden. It was hard enough to keep still, but it was harder yet to\\r\\n\\n\\ngive up a visit to the Sanders ranch, for just at this time Mr. Sanders\\r\\n\\n\\nappeared and insisted upon bearing at least one of the girls away with\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. The invitation was originally intended for the twins, but since\\r\\n\\n\\nJean could not go and it would never do to let Jack go unattended by\\r\\n\\n\\none of the family, Mrs. Corner decided that Mary Lee should accompany\\r\\n\\n\\nher sister. At first Mary Lee was not enthusiastic, but later on she\\r\\n\\n\\ncame to her mother and reported that she would as lief go as not.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I hate to leave the señorita,\" she said, \"but maybe I can do her more\\r\\n\\n\\ngood by going than by staying;\" which mysterious speech her mother did\\r\\n\\n\\nnot ask to have explained.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think,\" she said, \"you can do better for everybody by going, for\\r\\n\\n\\nI should not want Jack to be among strangers with no one to watch\\r\\n\\n\\nher, and you are rather more sedate than Nan, or rather you are more\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter-of-fact, and will be more liable to keep her steady. Nan can\\r\\n\\n\\nget her out of scrapes, but what I want you to do is to keep her from\\r\\n\\n\\ngetting into them.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd so Mary Lee and Jack started off, leaving Jean with a forlorn but\\r\\n\\n\\nresigned countenance watching them. She had been promised all sorts\\r\\n\\n\\nof treats at home to make up for her disappointment, so she was not\\r\\n\\n\\nentirely unhappy. Mrs. Roberts had promised to send a carriage for her\\r\\n\\n\\nto come and spend the day, Carter had said he would take her upon a\\r\\n\\n\\nspecial ride in his automobile when they would stop for soda water, Nan\\r\\n\\n\\nhad already begun some lovely paper dolls with wonderful costumes, and\\r\\n\\n\\nLi Hung was going to make some little cakes of which she was specially\\r\\n\\n\\nfond. Yet it was hard to see her twin drive off for a week\\'s stay and\\r\\n\\n\\nto feel that she was out of it in the matter of seeing Bessie Sanders.\\r\\n\\n\\nJean and Jack had talked so much about this visit and now Jack was\\r\\n\\n\\ngoing without her twin. Tears actually began to roll down from her eyes\\r\\n\\n\\nas she watched Mr. Sanders\\' carriage out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut just then Nan came over to comfort her, seeing the forlorn little\\r\\n\\n\\nfigure with foot propped upon a pillow. \"Poor itty sing,\" she said,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"they\\'ve gone and left us both, haven\\'t they?

              " Document(page_content='something pleasant right away. Here is a magic flower,\" she leaned\\r\\n\\n\\nover and gathered a rose from the vine clambering up the veranda; \"make\\r\\n\\n\\nthree wishes out loud and I will summon the genii. Shut your eyes and\\r\\n\\n\\nmake the wishes.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Nan,\" exclaimed Jean, half inclined to believe in the magic\\r\\n\\n\\nflower. \"Do you mean truly?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Of course I do. Hurry up and make your three wishes. Take the flower\\r\\n\\n\\nin your hand. Abracadabra! Go ahead. Close your eyes first.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean\\'s eyelids fell and she began: \"I wish for a little pony----\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"One.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And a--a--box of candy.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Two.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And--and--oh, dear, what do I want most?

Upon a chair before her was the picture of a\\r\\n\\n\\npony cut from a magazine.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now, Nan,\" began Jean, half disappointed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t say a live pony,\" Nan explained; \"you should have said\\r\\n\\n\\nthat, you know. Shut your eyes again and wait for your second wish.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean\\'s eyes fell and at the second bidding she opened them to see a\\r\\n\\n\\nbona fide box of candy which Nan had mysteriously produced. The third\\r\\n\\n\\nwish was as realistic, for the actual dollar was hers, so that by the\\r\\n\\n\\ntime Jack was well on her way, Jean was entirely comforted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was a pleasant trip, and most did they enjoy the last three miles\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich took them from the railway station. They drove into the gate with\\r\\n\\n\\na dash. A man came forward to take the horses as Mr. Sanders jumped out\\r\\n\\n\\nof the carriage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s Jo Poker,\" exclaimed Mary Lee. \"How did you get here?\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nasked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe man frowned, but immediately upon seeing who it was he smiled.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, it\\'s the little gal that wanted to see the pine squirrel,\" he\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid. \"How did you get here? I might ask.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I came on a visit,\" Mary Lee told him.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And I came to turn an honest penny,\" he said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs he drove away Mary Lee turned to Mr. Sanders. \"How did you get hold\\r\\n\\n\\nof him? I saw him \\'way down toward San Bernardino.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, he travels around, works when he feels like it, loafs when he\\r\\n\\n\\npleases. He\\'s a good worker when he takes hold of a job, and I\\'m always\\r\\n\\n\\nglad to get him. It isn\\'t every one he\\'ll work for.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Have you known him long?\" Mary Lee kept up her questions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I\\'ve known him for years. Saw him first down in Mexico, and\\r\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve run across him on and off ever since. Sometimes not for two or\\r\\n\\n\\nthree years and then suddenly he\\'d turn up in some entirely different\\r\\n\\n\\nplace. He\\'s a born rover.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do you suppose all those stories they tell about him are true?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s hard telling. He\\'s no saint, but I guess he\\'s not as black\\r\\n\\n\\nas he\\'s painted. He\\'s always acted white with me. There\\'s mother\\r\\n\\n\\nwaiting for you.

Want to go \\'long?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee willingly followed into the large neat kitchen where she\\r\\n\\n\\nwatched Mrs. Sanders stir up biscuits for supper and prepare chickens\\r\\n\\n\\nfor frying.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s just the way we do them at home,\" said Mary Lee. \"Are you from\\r\\n\\n\\nVirginia, Mrs. Sanders?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, but I\\'m next door to it; I\\'m from Maryland. I always maintain\\r\\n\\n\\nthere\\'s no better cooks in the universe than Marylanders, and that\\r\\n\\n\\nnobody knows so well how to eat good. I\\'ve been away from there right\\r\\n\\n\\nsmart of a while, but I never saw any place where the eatings suited me\\r\\n\\n\\nso well. Mr. Sanders says that\\'s what first made him take notice to me.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe\\'d eat such an awful good supper at our house, and he kept thinking\\r\\n\\n\\nhe\\'d certainly like it to last, then when he found out I\\'d made the\\r\\n\\n\\nbiscuits and fried the chicken he just set up to me right off. My, I\\r\\n\\n\\nnever expected to come to California then or I mightn\\'t have been so\\r\\n\\n\\nparticular about my cooking. It\\'s a good bit of a way from home out\\r\\n\\n\\nhere.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Was it at your home in Maryland that you first met him?\" asked Mary\\r\\n\\n\\nLee, interested in Mr. Sanders\\' courtship.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, at my father\\'s house. He\\'d come east for the first time since\\r\\n\\n\\nhe left home, and he was down our way. My brother invited him to the\\r\\n\\n\\nhouse; they\\'d been to school together when they were boys, and he\\'d\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen hunting up his old friends, you see. Well, when he went back he\\r\\n\\n\\ntook me along to Texas, and from there we come to California. He\\'s a\\r\\n\\n\\ngood bit older than me, but I reckon we get along as well as most. I\\r\\n\\n\\nget to thinking about home once in a while, but I\\'ve never regretted\\r\\n\\n\\nmarrying.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You like it out here, don\\'t you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I like it. At first I pined for the old Eastern Sho\\', and I yet\\r\\n\\n\\nthink it is the best spot on earth, but I\\'m satisfied. He\\'s a good\\r\\n\\n\\nhusband and father and we\\'re better off every year.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee watched the deft tossing together of the biscuits, and her own\\r\\n\\n\\nthoughts wandered back to her Virginia home, to Aunt Sarah, with Mitty\\r\\n\\n\\nin the kitchen, and Unc\\' Landy plodding about doing his chores.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe biscuits done, Mrs. Sanders left the baking of them to the Mexican\\r\\n\\n\\nwoman, and returned to the house. \"I\\'ll go slick up a bit before\\r\\n\\n\\nsupper,\" she said. \"You go make yourself at home anywhere you feel\\r\\n\\n\\ninclined.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt occurred to Mary Lee that it was time to discover Jack\\'s whereabouts\\r\\n\\n\\nand she ran out of doors to find her happily playing with Bessie under\\r\\n\\n\\nthe trees and in no need of sisterly attention. Therefore she went\\r\\n\\n\\nindoors for her work-bag and established herself on the veranda where\\r\\n\\n\\nshe could watch the children and at the same time could occupy herself\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her drawn work. She sat, a neat, sedate little figure at which Jo\\r\\n\\n\\nPoker cast more than one glance as he passed by.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nOn his way back he paused. \"You got back all right that day?\" he said\\r\\n\\n\\ninquiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What day? Oh, yes, thank you. I have not forgotten what a nice time we\\r\\n\\n\\nhad there in the woods.\" Then following out the train of thought which\\r\\n\\n\\nhad been taking up her mind she said: \"Did you ever know any people by\\r\\n\\n\\nthe name of Mendez or Garcia?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe did not answer for a moment but fixed his eyes upon her searchingly,\\r\\n\\n\\nthen, evidently with an effort, \"Yes, I did. They\\'re not unusual names.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhere did those you speak of hail from?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know exactly; somewhere in Mexico. I knew you had a Mexican\\r\\n\\n\\nwife, and I thought maybe you could tell me something I want to find\\r\\n\\n\\nout.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I reckon I can\\'t,\" said the man shortly. \"It\\'s been years since\\r\\n\\n\\nI saw any of them; before you were born.\" And without stopping to\\r\\n\\n\\ncontinue the conversation he walked away.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Mary Lee, \"he\\'s not very polite, but maybe he thought I\\r\\n\\n\\nwas inquisitive. I\\'ll ask Mr. Sanders what he knows.\" This she did that\\r\\n\\n\\nsame evening. \"You knew our señorita when she was a little girl, didn\\'t', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",

The one who was here with you all?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, but we call her Miss Garcia.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To be sure; her aunt did adopt her, I remember. She was a quiet little\\r\\n\\n\\nkitten, pretty in a way, but she kept to herself. I used to see her\\r\\n\\n\\naround. Her mother was dead then, but her grandfather set great store\\r\\n\\n\\nby her.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Did you know her father?\" asked Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, I didn\\'t, and funny, they never used to speak of him. I believe\\r\\n\\n\\nhis daughter\\'s marriage was a great disappointment to the old man, who\\r\\n\\n\\nhadn\\'t much use for Americans, at least that is what I heard. I believe\\r\\n\\n\\nthere was a cousin he wanted her to marry, but I don\\'t know. They said\\r\\n\\n\\nher husband was a very decent sort of fellow, but I never met him, not\\r\\n\\n\\nto know him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThen said Mary Lee to herself, \"if it was Jo Poker, Mr. Sanders doesn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nknow it.\" She thought over this for awhile and then she remarked:\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t Jo Poker a queer name?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He is a queer Dick,\" returned Mr. Sanders. \"All the years I have known\\r\\n\\n\\nhim I don\\'t know much more about him than I did at first. You never\\r\\n\\n\\nknow when or where he is going to turn up. When he leaves me like as\\r\\n\\n\\nnot he\\'ll go as far as \\'Frisco, or maybe Seattle, there\\'s no telling.\\r\\n\\n\\nI may not see him again for a year. He\\'ll take his run then go back\\r\\n\\n\\nto his cabin and stay there as if he wanted to get shet of the whole\\r\\n\\n\\nworld, that is, the human part of it. I think he\\'s above the common\\r\\n\\n\\nrun, he talks so sensible. If he takes a shine to any one he\\'s decent\\r\\n\\n\\nenough, but if he don\\'t, then look out. I was able to do him a good\\r\\n\\n\\nturn once and he ain\\'t forgot it, that\\'s why he\\'s ready to work on my\\r\\n\\n\\nranch when he comes this way.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Do you suppose his name is really Jo Poker?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, it isn\\'t, but he\\'ll not tell what it is, and one name is as good\\r\\n\\n\\nas another for his purpose. He gets Jo everywhere, anyway.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"When he dies will they just put Jo Poker on his tombstone, I wonder,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Mary Lee reflectively.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Sanders smiled. \"I can\\'t prophesy as to that. No doubt when that\\r\\n\\n\\ntime comes somebody will come forward and give his pedigree, or maybe\\r\\n\\n\\nhe\\'ll leave papers.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe mysterious Jo Poker continued to interest Mary Lee and she always\\r\\n\\n\\nsmiled on him when he appeared. One day he stopped suddenly at the\\r\\n\\n\\nveranda. \"Want to go to the woods and see one of those pine squirrels?\"\\r\\n\\n\\nhe said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'d love to,\" returned Mary Lee, jumping up. \"May I bring my\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle sister and Bess?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, yes, I reckon. That\\'s a wide awake little gal, your sister. She\\r\\n\\n\\ncan ask more questions to the square inch than anybody I know. Yes,\\r\\n\\n\\nfetch her along; I\\'ll be out there by the first windmill.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee ran to find Jack and presently the three children, joined by\\r\\n\\n\\nJo, were on their way to the nearest stretch of woods. Here the saucy\\r\\n\\n\\nlittle Douglas squirrel had his home. As soon as his visitors appeared\\r\\n\\n\\nhe rushed down the tree where he was lodged, uttered his peculiar cry\\r\\n\\n\\nand made a sudden dash at them as if he would eat them up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack laughed with glee. \"Do it again, do it again,\" she called to\\r\\n\\n\\nhim. But seeing that these beings kept their ground Mars\\' Squirrel\\r\\n\\n\\nbegan a series of antics, ran up and down the trunk of the tree,\\r\\n\\n\\ncutting all sorts of queer figures, and coming so near that they could\\r\\n\\n\\nlook into his large bright eyes. It was evident that he was very\\r\\n\\n\\ncurious about his callers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPresently Jo Poker took a flute from his pocket, fitted it together\\r\\n\\n\\nand began to play softly.

After awhile he crept slowly\\r\\n\\n\\nalong and leaped on Jo\\'s shoulder, nosing the flute while he played.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe children clapped their hands over their mouths lest some sound\\r\\n\\n\\nshould disturb him. Presently Jo changed the tune to a slow lugubrious\\r\\n\\n\\nmeasure, and at once the squirrel leaped back into the tree, sat upon\\r\\n\\n\\nhis haunches and scolded vigorously. This was not the kind of music he\\r\\n\\n\\npreferred. Jo took the flute from his lips, wiped it off and looked\\r\\n\\n\\nup at the little creature. \"Don\\'t like that, hey? Well, how\\'s this?\"\\r\\n\\n\\nand he played a little Scotch air which brought bunny down again to\\r\\n\\n\\nhis shoulder, and also enticed from the tree-tops several birds which\\r\\n\\n\\nfluttered nearer and nearer, but they, too, flew off when the mournful\\r\\n\\n\\ntune was repeated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n[Illustration: A LITTLE SCOTCH AIR BROUGHT BUNNY TO HIS\\r\\n\\n\\nSHOULDER.]\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter a time Jo declared the concert was over, and put his flute back\\r\\n\\n\\ninto his pocket. \"It\\'s queer,\" he said, \"how wild things have a taste\\r\\n\\n\\nin music. I\\'ve been out here every day for a week, and they\\'ve got to\\r\\n\\n\\nknow me, but they act just the same every time I play that old psalm\\r\\n\\n\\ntune. Ain\\'t it funny? I thought you\\'d like to see how they behave as\\r\\n\\n\\nlong as you like the woods\\' creeturs.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I love them,\" said Mary Lee, fervently. \"I wish I knew as much about\\r\\n\\n\\nthem as you do.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I could tell you a good bit,\" said Jo, \"and I could show you some\\r\\n\\n\\nqueer corners of the earth where things go on you wouldn\\'t suspect.\\r\\n\\n\\nAny time you want to go \\'long, I\\'ll be glad of your company. I get off\\r\\n\\n\\nabout this time every evening.\" So almost every day after this the\\r\\n\\n\\ntwo could be seen trudging off together, talking earnestly, and as\\r\\n\\n\\nthe secrets of the woods were revealed to her, Mary Lee became very\\r\\n\\n\\nconfidential with Jo Poker.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If I had a gal,\" he told her one day, \"I\\'d like her to be just like\\r\\n\\n\\nyou. I\\'d like her to want to go traipsing through the bogs and over\\r\\n\\n\\nrough ground, to be fond of the beasts and birds, to like the smell of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe earth and the dry leaves, and not to mind camping out in the open.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe your daughter would be like that if you should find her,\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe shook his head. \"I\\'ve give her up, you know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But why should you? I am sure you could take care of her?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"In a way, but she mightn\\'t like my way. She might want store clothes\\r\\n\\n\\nand fancy hats. She might mope if she hadn\\'t company, and she mightn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nwant to turn her hand to making a home. I\\'ve thought it all out, and I\\r\\n\\n\\nreckon it\\'s better to let well enough alone.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Maybe you are right about it,\" said Mary Lee slowly, and thinking of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe señorita. She could not imagine Miss Dolores tramping the silent\\r\\n\\n\\nwoods, cooking a meal over a camp-fire or sleeping in a mountain hut.\\r\\n\\n\\nNo, she agreed with Jo, it was better to let well enough alone. Yet\\r\\n\\n\\nduring one of their tramps and in a burst of confidence she told him\\r\\n\\n\\nthe señorita\\'s story.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe listened silently, poking the rich leaf mould beneath him as he sat\\r\\n\\n\\non a fallen log.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What did you say her name was?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee gave it in full.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nHe repeated it slowly. \"The Mendez was her mother\\'s name, and Garcia\\r\\n\\n\\nher aunt\\'s.

Fancy work isn\\'t my\\r\\n\\n\\nforte. What\\'s yours?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, really, I don\\'t know,\" returned Charlotte. \"I prefer music to any\\r\\n\\n\\nother accomplishment.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, do you? Good! That\\'s my best love, too. I am trying to play duets\\r\\n\\n\\nwith the señorita and it is such fun, though I am not an advanced\\r\\n\\n\\nstudent. I\\'ve not been taking lessons very long. We are doing some\\r\\n\\n\\nfascinating Spanish dances now, and it is such good practice, for you\\r\\n\\n\\nhave to skurry around to keep the right tempo. Do you think you have a\\r\\n\\n\\nvoice? I am wild to sing as well as to play, but I don\\'t know what sort\\r\\n\\n\\nof pipe I shall develop. The señorita says if I sing anything it will\\r\\n\\n\\nbe contralto, but I have my doubts of having any voice at all. Come on\\r\\n\\n\\ndown. If you love music we\\'ll be friends at once.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis common bond did unloosen their tongues and did away with\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte\\'s apparent reserve, therefore in a few minutes they were\\r\\n\\n\\nchatting pleasantly on the veranda. Nan was a good talker and Charlotte\\r\\n\\n\\na good listener. The contrast between Nan\\'s drawl and Charlotte\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nquick crisp Northern mode of speech amused Mrs. Roberts as she heard\\r\\n\\n\\ntheir chatter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am studying at the Boston Conservatory,\" Charlotte told Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That is where my Aunt Helen wants me to go, and perhaps I shall.\\r\\n\\n\\nMother is a little doubtful, but Aunt Helen believes in a very broad\\r\\n\\n\\neducation and thinks it will do us good to go up north for a year.

I go several times a season, and always to the Boston\\r\\n\\n\\nSymphony. I have not heard all the Wagner operas, but I shall.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt once Charlotte appeared much more grown up than Nan\\'s self. It was\\r\\n\\n\\nvery young ladyish to go to operas and to Symphony concerts. \"Tell me\\r\\n\\n\\nall about where you live,\" Nan went on. \"I like to know about people\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nhomes; I can get them into my mind better when I know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We live just out of Boston, at Brookline; it is a lovely place with\\r\\n\\n\\nmany handsome residences.

Our house is old and we have a lot\\r\\n\\n\\nof ground, too, and a garden.

Is your name Anna, by the way?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, it\\'s Nancy, just Nancy, with Nan for short. I used to like\\r\\n\\n\\nNannette till Aunt Helen told me about a maid she had in Paris who was\\r\\n\\n\\nvery dishonest; her name was Nannette, so now I\\'m plain Nancy, very\\r\\n\\n\\nplain,\" she added laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh!\" Charlotte looked at her, surprised that she should allude to her\\r\\n\\n\\nappearance in such a light manner. She didn\\'t think Nan at all plain\\r\\n\\n\\nwith her starlike eyes and glowing color, but if Nan herself thought\\r\\n\\n\\nso, it was a very outspoken thing for her to mention it.

In the morning they\\r\\n\\n\\nplayed duets, in the afternoon they read or walked or drove, and more\\r\\n\\n\\nthan one night Nan stayed with Charlotte. One afternoon Nan proposed\\r\\n\\n\\nthat they should take their books and go to a spot she called the Fairy\\r\\n\\n\\nDell. \"You don\\'t know how lovely it is there,\" she said. \"It\\'s not far,\\r\\n\\n\\nand there are all sorts of things growing; mosses for fairy couches and\\r\\n\\n\\ntiny rose-colored toad-stools for seats, then there are lots of fairy\\r\\n\\n\\nflowers and little gnome-like corners.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte laughed. \"You are so imaginative,\" she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I get ever so much fun out of it,\" returned Nan. \"I\\'m glad I am not\\r\\n\\n\\nmatter-of-fact. What books shall we take? I have a lovely illustrated\\r\\n\\n\\nedition of \\'An Old-fashioned Girl,\\' that was given me at Christmas;\\r\\n\\n\\nwe might take that. Do you like the Jungle books and the \\'Just So\\r\\n\\n\\nStories\\'? Jean and Jack have those.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte decided on the \"Just So Stories\" which she had not read and\\r\\n\\n\\nNan went to get the book from Jean who was very ready to lend it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Where are you going, Nan?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To the Fairy Dell with Charlotte,\" responded Nan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, mayn\\'t I go?\" begged Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"With that weak little ankle? Better not. You might fall over some of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe fairy snares or into the holes of the gnomes,\" said Nan as she ran\\r\\n\\n\\nout with the book.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean looked after her wistfully. This was not the first time Nan had\\r\\n\\n\\nmentioned the Fairy Dell and Jean had long been consumed with a desire\\r\\n\\n\\nto see it. Nan was always so mysterious about it and always made some\\r\\n\\n\\nexcuse not to take her little sister with her when she went there.\\r\\n\\n\\nIt must be a wonderful place, Jean thought, and even if one did not\\r\\n\\n\\nsee fairies it would be something to see where fairies lived. So\\r\\n\\n\\nregardless of her lame ankle, Jean resolved to follow, and when Nan\\r\\n\\n\\nstarted forth with Charlotte she limped at a safe distance behind.\\r\\n\\n\\nBut before the little ravine was reached one came to a house set by\\r\\n\\n\\nitself with a large garden around it. By the time the two older girls\\r\\n\\n\\nreached it Jean was far behind and her lame ankle began to pain her.\\r\\n\\n\\nYet she kept on as she saw the others descend the hill at the side of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe house and gathered up new strength to press on. It would never do\\r\\n\\n\\nto give up now when she had come this far. But just as she reached the\\r\\n\\n\\ngateway of the big house a large dog stalked out and stood barring the\\r\\n\\n\\nway. If there was one thing above another that Jean was afraid of it\\r\\n\\n\\nwas a strange dog, and she stood stock still gazing fearfully at this\\r\\n\\n\\nguardian of the mysterious dell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt last, plucking up her courage, she dashed past him and at once he\\r\\n\\n\\nfollowed barking loudly. Jean turned her head to see him loping after\\r\\n\\n\\nher and her terror increased. Stumbling, hobbling, crying, she rushed\\r\\n\\n\\non, the dog barking and gaining upon her. It was horrible, she thought.\\r\\n\\n\\nWould she never reach the spot where Nan was? \"Nan! Nan!\" she cried\\r\\n\\n\\nwildly. \"Oh, Nan, come help me. Drive him away! Drive him away!\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt last Nan heard. She was just looking around for a comfortable spot\\r\\n\\n\\nin which to settle down, that she and Charlotte might read undisturbed,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen Jean\\'s cries reached her. \"I believe that\\'s some one calling me,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe exclaimed running back to the point at which they had entered the\\r\\n\\n\\ndell. Then she saw Jean crying with fear and almost falling as she ran,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe big dog close upon her heels. \"Why, Jean, Jean,\" called Nan, \"what\\r\\n\\n\\nis the matter?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The dog! the dog!\" gasped Jean. \"Oh, drive him away!\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, he won\\'t hurt you,\" said Nan. \"Nice doggie, come here.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean shrieked with terror. \"Send him away!

Once he stopped and\\r\\n\\n\\nlooked back as if wondering why this acquaintance, who had always been\\r\\n\\n\\nfriendly, should suddenly turn against him and show a distaste for\\r\\n\\n\\nhis company. Nan gathered up Jean in her arms. \"Why, you poor little\\r\\n\\n\\nhop-pity-go-kick, what did you come all this way for? Is anything wrong\\r\\n\\n\\nat home? Did mother send you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No,\" sobbed Jean. \"I wanted so much to see the Fairy Dell.

Charlotte doesn\\'t know about the fairies as we do,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe whispered to Jean, \"and she doesn\\'t believe in the Guardian Dog.\\r\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t you know all fairy dells have some sort of guardian? Sometimes\\r\\n\\n\\nit\\'s an owl; sometimes another kind of bird or beast. This one has\\r\\n\\n\\na dog, but he wouldn\\'t hurt you unless you came to steal the fairy\\r\\n\\n\\ntreasures. He had to find out why you were coming to his fairies\\' dell\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout being invited.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJean looked so troubled that Charlotte said, \"What nonsense, Nan.

Rest it on\\r\\n\\n\\nthat mossy cushion and we\\'ll read to you about \\'The Cat that walks by\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\' I\\'ll go over to that tree and whisper a charm first, so the\\r\\n\\n\\nfairies won\\'t be offended at your coming.\" She gravely took her way to\\r\\n\\n\\nthe tree and whispered loud enough for Jean to hear:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n    \"Fairies bright, fairies light,\\r\\n\\n\\n    Hiding from us out of sight,\\r\\n\\n\\n    She who seeks your fairy dell\\r\\n\\n\\n    Is a friend who loves you well.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"There,\" she said, \"that is all right.

After a while I will show you.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe was as good as her word and when the story was finished she took\\r\\n\\n\\nJean mysteriously to little holes in the ground, to crevices in the\\r\\n\\n\\nrocks, to overshadowed corners, till the child\\'s fancy was filled with\\r\\n\\n\\nimaginary beings who peopled the fairy dell.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nBut when they started home the little girl lagged painfully. \"This will\\r\\n\\n\\nnever do,\" said Nan. \"You\\'ve overtaxed your ankle, Jean, and you\\'ll\\r\\n\\n\\nhave to get home some other way than by walking all the distance.

Tell us what you did at the Sanders\\', Mary Lee.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, we did everything; rode and walked and ate raisins and honey and\\r\\n\\n\\nall sorts of good things, and oh, Nan, Jo Poker was there.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Jo Poker? Well, did you ever! Do tell me about him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We saw him every day, and he used to take me to the woods and tell me\\r\\n\\n\\nabout all the queer things we saw. I like him so much. We used to have\\r\\n\\n\\nlong talks and I told him all about the señorita, but he didn\\'t seem to\\r\\n\\n\\nknow anything or if he did he wouldn\\'t tell me. I certainly had a fine\\r\\n\\n\\ntime, Nan, but I am glad to get home again. I do hope mother and Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nDolores won\\'t stay out long; I am just aching to see them.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJust then Miss Helen came in. \"Why,\" she said, \"my girlies are back\\r\\n\\n\\nagain. We certainly did miss you, and it is good to have you again.\\r\\n\\n\\nNan, before I forget it, Mrs. Roberts wants you to come over and take\\r\\n\\n\\nsupper. Charlotte is going to-morrow or next day.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, and the girls have just come,\" returned Nan discontentedly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I never expected to see the time when you wouldn\\'t jump at an\\r\\n\\n\\ninvitation from Mrs. Roberts,\" said Miss Helen.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But then there was never a time before when Mary Lee and Jack had been\\r\\n\\n\\naway for a whole week,\" said Nan by way of excuse.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That is true,\" said Miss Helen smiling. \"Well, you must manage it for\\r\\n\\n\\nyourself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I won\\'t go till nearly supper time,\" Nan concluded, \"and I will\\r\\n\\n\\ncome back as soon after as it is decent. To tell you the truth,\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nwhispered to Mary Lee as they went out of the room with their arms\\r\\n\\n\\naround each other, \"Charlotte and I had a little spat.

Nan told her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" decided the impartial Mary Lee, \"I think it was as much your\\r\\n\\n\\nfault as hers.

I reckon some\\r\\n\\n\\nof it was my fault. She is really a very nice girl, but her ways aren\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nours and she doesn\\'t take to being free and easy.

I know perfectly well she wouldn\\'t have done me that mean way, and\\r\\n\\n\\nI reckon that is half the reason why I am mad. I wish you would go over\\r\\n\\n\\nwith me, Mary Lee; it would take off the edge.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, but I am not asked.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You would be if Mrs. Bobs knew you had come back. I\\'ll \\'phone over and\\r\\n\\n\\ntell her,\" and before Mary Lee could say a word Nan had flown to the\\r\\n\\n\\ntelephone. She came back in a few minutes. \"Mrs. Bobs is delighted,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe reported. \"She wants you to meet Charlotte. I know Charlotte will\\r\\n\\n\\nlike you for you are just the proper kind to suit her. I am such a\\r\\n\\n\\nfly-away, I am afraid, and she doesn\\'t understand me, when I talk up in\\r\\n\\n\\nthe clouds, any more than you do.\" She hurried herself into a proper\\r\\n\\n\\nfrock and rebraided her hair with hasty fingers. \"Button my middle\\r\\n\\n\\nbutton, please, Mary Lee,\" she said. \"Oh, but it is good to have you\\r\\n\\n\\nback.

Aren\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nyou sorry?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"For some reasons I am, but for others I am not. I like to see new\\r\\n\\n\\nthings and new places.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"So do I, but I get attached to the old ones. I think there is\\r\\n\\n\\nsomething very catty about me, for I cling to my old haunts.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You are more kittenish, I should say,\" returned Mary Lee slyly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan laughed, and did not resent the charge.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte met them rather stiffly but thawed out under Nan\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\ngraciousness, and her frank avowal that she had been in the wrong the\\r\\n\\n\\nday before. It is quite true that Charlotte would not have acted as Nan\\r\\n\\n\\ndid, but it is equally true that she would never have been willing to\\r\\n\\n\\napologize so readily for any misdeed of her own.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I want you and Mary Lee to know each other,\" Nan told her. \"You are\\r\\n\\n\\njust of a piece, you two.

Mary Lee she might like and would\\r\\n\\n\\nprobably always easily get along with, but to Nan she would continue to\\r\\n\\n\\ngive a warmer affection from the very fact that she was the opposite of\\r\\n\\n\\nherself.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Roberts insisted upon seeing the girls home, although Carter\\r\\n\\n\\nappeared on the scene, saying he had been sent as an escort. Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nRoberts was rather a quiet, grave man, but Nan never failed to unloosen\\r\\n\\n\\nhis tongue and his face always brightened when she came around.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like to say good-bye,\" said Nan to Charlotte, \"and I don\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nmean to to-night, for I\\'ll come around first thing in the morning\\r\\n\\n\\nso as to see you off. I will send you some picture postal cards,\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte, and you must do the same to me. I have enjoyed our music so\\r\\n\\n\\nmuch, and some day I hope I will play as well as you do. We have had\\r\\n\\n\\na real good time together, even if we have had some squabbles. I was\\r\\n\\n\\ngenerally wrong and you were right,\" which admission Charlotte felt was\\r\\n\\n\\ntruly noble.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"If you ever come to Boston,\" she said with more warmth than usual,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"you must be sure to let me know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed I will. Very likely I shall come some day. I mean to get in\\r\\n\\n\\na lot of traveling during my life, and you may expect to see me most\\r\\n\\n\\nanywhere you go. Wouldn\\'t it be fine if we were to meet in Germany some\\r\\n\\n\\nday? Perhaps both of us will go there to study music.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That would be delightful,\" returned Charlotte.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, who knows?\" continued Nan. \"Let\\'s pretend we shall. Auf\\r\\n\\n\\nwiedersehn, Miss Loring, I shall expect to see you one of these days at\\r\\n\\n\\nHerr Pumpernickel\\'s studio in Berlin,\" and, kissing her hand, Nan ran\\r\\n\\n\\ndown the step to join Mr. Roberts, who was waiting for her. Carter and\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee had gone on ahead.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCharlotte turned to Mrs. Roberts and made the confession: \"I would\\r\\n\\n\\ngive anything to be as delightfully easy as Nan is. She is never\\r\\n\\n\\nembarrassed and always knows just what to say. She is the brightest\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl I ever saw. I don\\'t mean that she is so very, very intellectual,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor there are a great many things she has not read, things that most of\\r\\n\\n\\nmy girl friends know all about, but she is so originally bright. She\\r\\n\\n\\nnever says things for effect or as if she were conscious of herself.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That is just Nan\\'s charm,\" returned Mrs. Roberts. \"She is naturally\\r\\n\\n\\nvery quick-witted, and she has a ready vocabulary; when she can\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nthink of a word to suit the occasion she coins one that is somehow\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter than those made to order. Jack is something like her; she is\\r\\n\\n\\nan original, too, but in quite a different way. I wish you were going\\r\\n\\n\\nto stay long enough to see Jack; she is such a comical youngster. My\\r\\n\\n\\nfather makes her his special pet. They are a delightful family, take\\r\\n\\n\\nthem one and all, from Mrs. Corner down to the twins.

How would it do to arrange this way? It\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nnothing of a run from here to Santa Barbara. I can get my friend\\r\\n\\n\\nOliver\\'s car, which is a little larger than mine, and take five of you;\\r\\n\\n\\nthen I can come back here, get my car and take the other two.

I\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder if it will have to stop when I leave California.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I hope not,\" returned Miss Helen. \"You certainly are too young to have\\r\\n\\n\\nyour good times stop yet awhile. I prophesy many more; when you go to\\r\\n\\n\\nEurope, for instance.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, of course; that is at the very tip-top of good times. Shall I\\r\\n\\n\\nreally love Italy as much as I do California?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think so because of the precious pictures, the dear old buildings,\\r\\n\\n\\nthe savor of romance which you will find there. Every stone seems to\\r\\n\\n\\nhave a history, and the very bells peal out some bygone story. One\\r\\n\\n\\nmisses that here. There is so much that is startlingly new; it is the\\r\\n\\n\\noldness, the worn stones, the delightful subdued color which pleases\\r\\n\\n\\nthe eye over there. If it were not for the old missions I should find\\r\\n\\n\\neven California garish and crude, I am afraid.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis sounded like rank heresy to Nan, but she was satisfied that Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nHelen believed what she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It suits many persons better than Italy,\" Miss Helen went on, \"but\\r\\n\\n\\nit doesn\\'t happen to suit me so well. \\'Better twenty years of Europe\\r\\n\\n\\nthan a cycle of Cathay.\\' I agree with Tennyson. I am afraid, Nan dear,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat I have acquired the European habit and shall never be rid of it.\\r\\n\\n\\nI suppose it is because I have lived there so long, and because my old\\r\\n\\n\\nhome is mine no more.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis determined the fact that there would never be any prospect of a\\r\\n\\n\\npermanent settlement in California, for the Corners, and therefore the\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl was glad that she had borne away from the cottage those mementoes\\r\\n\\n\\nwhich should bring to her lips a wistful smile in after days.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe and Mary Lee cast a lingering look at the rose-hung house as the\\r\\n\\n\\nautomobile bore them away. \"Good-bye, good-bye, dear little place,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid Nan tragically. \"Farewell, roses and orange trees!

How well you are looking, Mary.\\r\\n\\n\\nSurely this winter has done you good.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Surely it has,\" returned Mrs. Corner. \"I feel as if I were almost\\r\\n\\n\\nsafe. I hope Carter may be.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I hope so. He thinks seriously of settling in this sunny land, he\\r\\n\\n\\ntells me, and I think he would be wise to do it. To be on the safe side\\r\\n\\n\\nis much better than to take any risks. The doctors tell him that he\\r\\n\\n\\nwill be likely to live as long as any one if he settles here, but with\\r\\n\\n\\nthat incipient tendency he will not feel quite sure at home. He is so\\r\\n\\n\\nyoung I believe in a few years he may entirely outgrow his trouble.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"His poor mother,\" said Mrs. Corner, \"how will she stand the\\r\\n\\n\\nseparation?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Better than if he were removed altogether,\" said Miss Helen gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mollie Carter is no weakling; she will not dissuade him from what is\\r\\n\\n\\nfor his best good. Moreover her other children will soon be old enough\\r\\n\\n\\nto be left at home and she can then come to Carter at least once a\\r\\n\\n\\nyear. Dear me, Mary, how many mothers must be separated from their\\r\\n\\n\\nchildren. Their daughters marry and follow their husbands to any part\\r\\n\\n\\nof the world; their sons accept positions which take them across the\\r\\n\\n\\nocean; it is one of the trials of motherhood, I admit, but it is not\\r\\n\\n\\na rare one. Now, you, my dear, will soon have to settle what is to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe done in your own case for next year. Shall it be California again\\r\\n\\n\\nor shall we go to Southern France and Italy? I do so want you to see\\r\\n\\n\\nEurope.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Can\\'t I wait till my girls are ready to go, too?\" said Mrs. Corner\\r\\n\\n\\nhelplessly. \"I cannot bear to put the ocean between us.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But you don\\'t want to risk a winter in the east and run the danger of\\r\\n\\n\\nleaving them altogether?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not that.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then suppose you let me tell you what I propose and you can think\\r\\n\\n\\nit over. Mrs. Roberts and I have had a talk about the girlies. She\\r\\n\\n\\nknows of an excellent school near Boston where only a few girls are\\r\\n\\n\\nadmitted as boarders. I think a little New England experience will not\\r\\n\\n\\nhurt our lassies. Nan could go to the Boston Conservatory and could\\r\\n\\n\\nhave the musical advantages which I should like for her. You know our\\r\\n\\n\\nold friend, Mr. Harmer is there and would take a personal interest\\r\\n\\n\\nin her. The Lorings, too, would make a special effort to be nice on\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Roberts\\'s account. Miss Sarah seems so content with the present\\r\\n\\n\\narrangement at home that she would be glad to continue it for another\\r\\n\\n\\nyear, I know. You and I would then be free to go abroad for the winter,\\r\\n\\n\\nor, if you found you could not stand being away so long, you could come\\r\\n\\n\\nback when you pleased and go to the Adirondacks or North Carolina. Now,\\r\\n\\n\\nthere is something for you to think about. Don\\'t decide now, but let it\\r\\n\\n\\nsoak in and tell me any time you may make up your mind.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner sat with a very thoughtful look on her face after her\\r\\n\\n\\nsister left the room. Nan, coming in, found her so. \"Sweetest and\\r\\n\\n\\nloveliest,\" she said, \"what are you thinking about? You didn\\'t hear me\\r\\n\\n\\nand I called you twice.\" She stooped over and kissed her mother\\'s cheek.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I was thinking of my bairns and was wondering what would be best for\\r\\n\\n\\nus all next winter.\" She drew Nan very close to her. \"I can\\'t bear to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe parted from you, darling.

I never dreamed of\\r\\n\\n\\nanything like it, and I hate to think of its being over, of our leaving\\r\\n\\n\\nCalifornia and the friends we have made here. Mrs. Roberts writes that\\r\\n\\n\\nher father is quite broken up by our going and goes around as if he\\r\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t know what to do with himself. She says the Corner family have\\r\\n\\n\\nbewitched him and that she will not be able to keep him with her much\\r\\n\\n\\nlonger. Of course he didn\\'t intend to stay as long as he has done, but\\r\\n\\n\\nshe likes to put it that way. Then there is the señorita, I know she\\r\\n\\n\\nfeels very badly at the idea of parting from us. Well, muzzy, dear,\\r\\n\\n\\nhave you made any plans?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Nothing is determined yet. I shall have some time in which to decide,\\r\\n\\n\\nbut your Aunt Helen has made a proposition which I am thinking over.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Tell me if it is tellable; I\\'ll not mention it if it is a secret.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t speak of it yet because the little girls could not\\r\\n\\n\\nunderstand the whys and wherefores,\" and then she told what Miss Helen\\r\\n\\n\\nhad proposed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t wonder you were so thoughtful and serious,\" said Nan gravely,\\r\\n\\n\\nwhen her mother had finished speaking. \"Gracious, but that is a problem\\r\\n\\n\\nto solve.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Should you like your part of the plan, Nan?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I should, and I shouldn\\'t. It is delightful in some respects, all but\\r\\n\\n\\nthe separation from you,\" she added with a little catch in her voice,\\r\\n\\n\\nand bending to lay her cheek against her mother\\'s hand. \"Oh, if we\\r\\n\\n\\ncould only have this winter all over again. Why couldn\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"For two or three reasons. I think your Aunt Helen pines for Europe.\\r\\n\\n\\nShe has lived so long abroad that she misses the art, the music, the\\r\\n\\n\\nolder civilization, and I cannot bear to have her sacrifice herself\\r\\n\\n\\nfor us. To be sure she could go alone, but we are all she has and she\\r\\n\\n\\nclings to us so. I cannot forget that she has been willing to give us\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf of what was legally hers.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It was what her mother and father both wanted her to do, and she\\r\\n\\n\\ncouldn\\'t have done differently, it seems to me.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Some persons would have. She has been more than generous, with her\\r\\n\\n\\nhalf, too.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"And you have never been to Europe,\" said Nan slowly. \"I think, mother,\\r\\n\\n\\nyou\\'d better go.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Nan!\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe girl\\'s eyes were full of tears which her mother did not see. \"Yes,\\r\\n\\n\\nI do,\" she answered bravely, \"but you don\\'t have to decide yet, do you?\\r\\n\\n\\nThere is plenty of time.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Plenty.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then don\\'t let us cross that bridge till we come to it. Who knows what\\r\\n\\n\\nmay turn up before we leave this Sunset Land? I, for one, am not going\\r\\n\\n\\nto think about it yet. Isn\\'t this Santa Barbara the dearest place? I\\r\\n\\n\\nloved San Diego; I was perfectly happy at Los Angeles; I thought no\\r\\n\\n\\nspot could be lovelier than Pasadena, and I\\'d like to stay here years;\\r\\n\\n\\nthat is the way it goes all along the King\\'s highway. I like that name;\\r\\n\\n\\nthe Camino Real, for it is so much more than an every-day road.

No, young lady, you needn\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nhave any fear but that Jennie will have an eye on her, and if she is\\r\\n\\n\\nlonely it will not be my daughter\\'s fault.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Shall I go tell her that you want to see her?\" asked Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Suppose you do, then we\\'ll settle it right here.\" So Mary Lee went off\\r\\n\\n\\nto seek Miss Dolores and presently left her in close conversation with\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              THE MESSAGE\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIt was the morning after they arrived at San Francisco that Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner came to Mary Lee\\'s door. \"Daughter,\" she said, \"Mr. Sanders is\\r\\n\\n\\ndown-stairs; he says he has something important to say to you.

Go down and see\\r\\n\\n\\nhim and I\\'ll be there directly.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWondering what Mr. Sanders could have to say to her especially, and\\r\\n\\n\\nhow he happened to be in San Francisco, Mary Lee went down to find her\\r\\n\\n\\nfriend waiting for her. \"Well, Miss Mary,\" he said, \"you didn\\'t expect\\r\\n\\n\\nto see me here, did you? I\\'ve come with a message for you; I have it\\r\\n\\n\\nhere.\" He produced an envelope which he held in his hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad to see you whatever brings you,\" returned Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it is rather a sad business that brings me. It\\'s queer you\\r\\n\\n\\nshould happen to be in this city just now and queerer still that I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould.\" He paused a moment. \"You remember Jo Poker, don\\'t you?\" he\\r\\n\\n\\nthen asked.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Indeed I do,\" answered Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Poor Jo! Well, miss, you\\'ll never see him again.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, Mr. Sanders, what has happened?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s paid his last debt, poor old Jo. He got hurt in a runaway awhile\\r\\n\\n\\nago and though at first they thought he would get over it, for he was\\r\\n\\n\\nwell enough to be about, he suddenly got worse and when he found his\\r\\n\\n\\nlast hour was nigh he sent for me. There\\'s a long story. Here\\'s your\\r\\n\\n\\nmother, I reckon she\\'d better have it, too. I was just saying, Mrs.\\r\\n\\n\\nCorner, that we\\'ve buried a friend of your daughter\\'s. I reckon you\\'ve\\r\\n\\n\\nheard her speak of Jo Poker.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The man who was so good to her when she was visiting at your house?\\r\\n\\n\\nYes, indeed. Both the girls have spoken of him often. Did you say that\\r\\n\\n\\nhe was dead, Mr. Sanders?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Yes, ma\\'am. He fell ill a couple of weeks ago after being in an\\r\\n\\n\\naccident, took a bad turn of a sudden and sent for me, said that there\\r\\n\\n\\nwasn\\'t any one nearer. He handed me over his papers and I learned\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom them that his name was Joseph Middleton. His father was a well\\r\\n\\n\\noff man at one time but I fancy he wasn\\'t always just straight in\\r\\n\\n\\nbusiness affairs. Jo was pretty wild in his young days and got into\\r\\n\\n\\nsome scrapes. Fought with his brother-in-law, a sort of duel, I should\\r\\n\\n\\njudge, cut him up pretty badly and had to get out and leave his wife\\r\\n\\n\\nat her father\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I knew his right name couldn\\'t be Poker,\" said Mary Lee listening\\r\\n\\n\\neagerly to the story. \"What did they fight about, Mr. Sanders?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, it seems that old Middleton bought a piece of property from a\\r\\n\\n\\nMexican, or Spaniard, Jo calls him, who thought afterward that there\\r\\n\\n\\nhadn\\'t been fair dealing and was bitter against the whole Middleton\\r\\n\\n\\nfamily. Jo fell in love with the daughter and she with him then, as\\r\\n\\n\\nhe wasn\\'t one to give up a thing, he wanted, he ran off with her and\\r\\n\\n\\nmarried her secretly. The brother caught him coming to the house two\\r\\n\\n\\nor three times after he had been forbidden the place, and they had it\\r\\n\\n\\nhot and heavy. The brother charged Jo with all sorts of things and went\\r\\n\\n\\nfor him. Jo didn\\'t stand still and the up-shot was that the brother got\\r\\n\\n\\nthe worst of it, so while he was lying between life and death Jo had to\\r\\n\\n\\nskip. The father was fiercer than ever against Jo and the young wife\\r\\n\\n\\nwas kept close as a nun. She lived only a short time and left a little\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl that she called Pepita.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Pepita,\" exclaimed Mary Lee. \"That was the name of Miss Dolores\\'\\r\\n\\n\\ncousin.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s quite a name among the Spanish, I believe,\" Mr. Sanders told her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s the same as our Josephine.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s why she gave her baby the name; it is the nearest she could\\r\\n\\n\\nget to calling it after her husband, poor thing.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t a doubt of it. She probably called him Pepé; that\\'s the\\r\\n\\n\\nSpanish for Jo. Well, old Middleton took to drinking, went through his\\r\\n\\n\\nmoney and Jo got reckless, too, after he heard that his wife was dead,\\r\\n\\n\\nso he never settled down anywhere.

              " Document(page_content='so he never settled down anywhere. Lived just like you know, Miss Mary,\\r\\n\\n\\nas I was telling you there at home. Never went back to claim his little\\r\\n\\n\\ngirl it seems, because he felt he couldn\\'t be any benefit to her, and\\r\\n\\n\\nshe had a good home with her mother\\'s people. Now he\\'s gone, and I am\\r\\n\\n\\nsorry, for I liked the man, though folks did say hard things of him.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe is about the last link to those old days when I was a youngster\\r\\n\\n\\nand first came out to this country. Most of the old crowd are dead or\\r\\n\\n\\nscattered; I don\\'t know which. I couldn\\'t put my finger on another if I\\r\\n\\n\\ntried.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You say this Joseph Middleton was talked about,\" said Mrs. Corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Was he then a bad man?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, ma\\'am, I shouldn\\'t call him bad exactly. He was his own worst\\r\\n\\n\\nenemy: I never knew him to harm any one but that brother of his wife\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nand he wouldn\\'t have touched him if he\\'d been let alone. He was always\\r\\n\\n\\ngood to animals and children and was always a gentleman to the women.\\r\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve seen worse men that had a better name, so I say he was more sinned\\r\\n\\n\\nagainst than sinning. This here envelope he asked me to hand you,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Sanders went on turning to Mary Lee. \"He said it had his good-bye\\r\\n\\n\\nmessage to you in it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I will read it now,\" said Mary Lee trembling a little as\\r\\n\\n\\nshe took the note. It seemed so strange that the kindly man who played\\r\\n\\n\\nto the birds and beasts, who was so alive to things of this earth,\\r\\n\\n\\nshould no longer be of this world. Mary Lee held the note closely. \"It\\r\\n\\n\\nwas very kind of him to want to bid me good-bye,\" she said, \"and kind\\r\\n\\n\\nof you to bring me the message. He used to say that if he should ever\\r\\n\\n\\nfind his daughter and if he were able to claim her he would like her to\\r\\n\\n\\nbe like me, fond of animals and woodsy things. I think that is why he\\r\\n\\n\\nwrote to me.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The daughter is dead, too, you know,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"He had found\\r\\n\\n\\nthat out, he told me.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee turned to her mother. \"I think I am glad of that,\" she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Now, maybe, they are all three together.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Well, I must be going,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"I am glad to have seen you\\r\\n\\n\\nagain.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The others will like to see you, Mr. Sanders,\" said Mrs. Corner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I know Jack will want to hear about your little girl. Go find your\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters, Mary Lee, and tell them Mr. Sanders is here.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee laid the envelope in her mother\\'s lap and went to seek the\\r\\n\\n\\nothers who came rushing in to ask about Bessie and to hear all the news\\r\\n\\n\\nof the ranch.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am so sorry Jo Poker is dead,\" said Jack; \"now he can never play on\\r\\n\\n\\nthe flute for us any more.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind, Jack,\" said Jean, \"perhaps he\\'s playing on a harp now.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"But I can\\'t hear him,\" returned Jack nothing comforted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAfter answering Jack\\'s hundred questions and being made the bearer of\\r\\n\\n\\nas many messages, Mr. Sanders took his leave saying that he must make\\r\\n\\n\\na train soon if he wanted to get home that night. \"I\\'m glad I had your\\r\\n\\n\\naddress,\" he said as he was about to go, \"or I mightn\\'t have been able\\r\\n\\n\\nto get that message delivered for some time.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee gathered the note again into her own keeping. \"Come, mother,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe said, \"let\\'s go somewhere by ourselves.

I feel so very solemn about it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll go to my room,\" said her mother leading the way.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee held the letter a few moments before breaking it open, then\\r\\n\\n\\nshe said suddenly: \"Suppose you read it to me, mother.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner settled herself by the window and Mary Lee leaned on the\\r\\n\\n\\nback of her chair.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Dear Miss Mary,\" the letter began, \"this is my farewell to you.

You\\r\\n\\n\\nasked me about that Miss Garcia, and now that all are dead and gone who\\r\\n\\n\\nwould care, in my judgment it isn\\'t fair to keep some things secret.\\r\\n\\n\\nHer Aunt Dolores Garcia was a good friend to me. She was my wife\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\ncousin and helped me in a time of great trouble. I promised her then\\r\\n\\n\\nthat while I lived I\\'d not tell all I knew about the family affairs.\\r\\n\\n\\nDolores Garcia\\'s sister married a young American. Her father hated all\\r\\n\\n\\nAmericans, because he was a proud Spaniard and because he thought one\\r\\n\\n\\nof them had cheated him and his brother out of their property. When\\r\\n\\n\\nhis daughter married a young fellow whose people wouldn\\'t acknowledge\\r\\n\\n\\nher----\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mother!\" cried Mary Lee.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What is it, daughter?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Never mind, go on,\" said Mary Lee breathlessly. \"Go on, quick, please.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Where was I? Oh yes: whose people wouldn\\'t acknowledge her the old don\\r\\n\\n\\nwas cut to the quick and vowed they should never know his daughter\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nchild to teach her to despise her family. He was very proud of his\\r\\n\\n\\nSpanish blood and he made every member of his family swear not to tell\\r\\n\\n\\nthe child\\'s name, or to let her father\\'s family know of her. The baby\\'s\\r\\n\\n\\nfather died before she was born and its mother soon after. It nearly\\r\\n\\n\\nbroke the old man\\'s heart, but he loved that baby as much as he hated\\r\\n\\n\\nher father\\'s people who were not to have the chance to acknowledge her\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause they refused to accept the mother.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, oh,\" whispered Mary Lee, \"doesn\\'t it tell the father\\'s name?

I have\\r\\n\\n\\nhere what you have not, a grandfather.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack and Jean hand in hand stood looking with grave curiosity as they\\r\\n\\n\\nsaw Mr. Pinckney gather their señorita close to him. \"I don\\'t believe\\r\\n\\n\\nit,\" said Jack; \"you\\'re just fooling us.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Are you her grandfather, Mr. St. Nick?\" asked Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am, my child, I am, and proud enough of it.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then why didn\\'t you tell us before?\" asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We have just found it out. Mary Lee was really the discoverer. I have\\r\\n\\n\\nbeen trying for many years to learn what she has found out to-day.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you ever have found out if it hadn\\'t been for Mary Lee?\"\\r\\n\\n\\nasked Jack eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I am afraid not.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nJack stood looking him up and down. \"Then aren\\'t you glad I bumped into\\r\\n\\n\\nyou that day in the candy shop?\" she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAt this every one burst into a laugh which was a relief to the\\r\\n\\n\\noverstrained feelings, and, after many congratulations and much hugging\\r\\n\\n\\nand kissing, the four Corners left the two Pinckneys to themselves.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                              CHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n                            HOMEWARD BOUND\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAs happy a party as ever gathered around a table sat down to dinner\\r\\n\\n\\nthat night. Mr. Pinckney had telegraphed to his daughter and had\\r\\n\\n\\nreceived an answering telegram which brought the promise of her\\r\\n\\n\\nspeedy arrival with her husband. Although overshadowed utterly by the\\r\\n\\n\\nseñorita, whose importance to their beloved Mr. St. Nick was such an\\r\\n\\n\\nevident fact, none of the children felt anything but pleasure in her\\r\\n\\n\\ndiscovery of this new relative. To be sure once during the evening Jack\\r\\n\\n\\nclimbed wistfully to her old friend\\'s knee, but though he put his arm\\r\\n\\n\\naround her, he did not take his eyes from his granddaughter\\'s face and\\r\\n\\n\\ndid not cease to make her the subject of his talk.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nCarter received the news with as much surprise as the girls expected\\r\\n\\n\\nand to him they now turned for entertainment since their older friend\\r\\n\\n\\nwas so engrossed in his own affairs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nWith his inclination to give pleasure, Mr. Pinckney could not rest till\\r\\n\\n\\nhe had taken Miss Dolores forth on a shopping expedition, and was\\r\\n\\n\\nready to buy her such an array of things as would have quite burdened\\r\\n\\n\\nher down, but Miss Helen came to her rescue.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I think New York still has some good shops,\" she reminded him, \"and\\r\\n\\n\\nwhat will be the use of taking such a lot of extra luggage east?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMr. Pinckney looked a little abashed at first reminder. \"I am an old\\r\\n\\n\\nidiot,\" he said laughing; \"I never thought of that. I\\'ll open up the\\r\\n\\n\\nold house in New York and set her at the head of it. We\\'ll get a good\\r\\n\\n\\nhousekeeper so Dolores won\\'t have too many cares,\" he patted his\\r\\n\\n\\ngranddaughter\\'s hand. \"We\\'ll come this way every year to see your Aunt\\r\\n\\n\\nJennie,\" he went on, \"and you\\'ll make friends there at home who won\\'t\\r\\n\\n\\nmind going shopping with you.

She would not be so far from the\\r\\n\\n\\nseñorita after all, and could hope to see her sometimes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll all go back together,\" said Mr. Pinckney. \"What do you say, good\\r\\n\\n\\npeople?

Every one thought it was adding better to good\\r\\n\\n\\nto have these two friends with them, since they had all enjoyed such\\r\\n\\n\\nhappy days together during the winter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s one thing I\\'ve set my heart on,\" said Mr. Pinckney one day; \"I\\r\\n\\n\\nwant you all to spend Christmas with us next year. Will you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Corner looked at Miss Helen. \"I\\'m afraid I can\\'t promise that,\"\\r\\n\\n\\nshe said. \"My sister and I will probably be too far away, but I shall\\r\\n\\n\\nbe happy to accept for my girls.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Why, mother!\" Mary Lee looked up surprised. \"Where are you going to be\\r\\n\\n\\nnext winter?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"In the south of France or in Italy, dear. Aunt Helen and I have made\\r\\n\\n\\nour plans for that. I must be in some mild climate, you know.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then are we to stay at home with Aunt Sarah?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Where then? Where?\" clamored the twins. \"Oh, mother, are you going to\\r\\n\\n\\ntake us with you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe put an arm around each. \"No, darlings, not this time, but some\\r\\n\\n\\nday I hope to. My four girlies are going to school.\" She turned to\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Roberts. \"I have had very satisfactory letters from Mrs. Morrison\\r\\n\\n\\nand if, after we have visited the place, it seems as attractive as it\\r\\n\\n\\npromises, we shall send the girls there.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, mother, where is it? I don\\'t want to go to boarding-school,\" said\\r\\n\\n\\nJack rebelliously. \"It will be horrid.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"This one will not be, I hope. It is near Boston and it is not a big\\r\\n\\n\\nschool; there are only twelve boarders admitted and there are pretty\\r\\n\\n\\ngrounds and I should think it must be a very homelike place from the\\r\\n\\n\\ndescription. Charlotte Loring will be one of your schoolmates during\\r\\n\\n\\nthe week, though she goes home from Friday till Monday, and I am sure\\r\\n\\n\\nyou will meet other very nice little girls. If you are not happy there\\r\\n\\n\\nafter one year\\'s trial, you shall not stay, and we will make some other\\r\\n\\n\\narrangement.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"How long shall you be away, mother?\" asked Jean wistfully.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Until May or June, I think.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s very long,\" sighed Jean.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMary Lee cuddled her to her side. \"But you will have your two big\\r\\n\\n\\nsisters,\" she said, \"and we are to spend Christmas in New York, think\\r\\n\\n\\nof that, with Miss Dolores and Mr. St. Nick.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThis was something to look forward to and Jean brightened up.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nAll this time Nan had not said a word.

              " Document(page_content='No mother, no Aunt Helen for all those long months. Even the exciting\\r\\n\\n\\npresent could not shut out this picture of a motherless winter. She sat\\r\\n\\n\\nwith hands tightly clasped and looked out the window with a set face.\\r\\n\\n\\nJack stole up and put an arm around her neck. \"Oh, Nan,\" she whispered,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"you feel just as I do. Don\\'t let\\'s go to that horrid school; let\\'s run\\r\\n\\n\\naway.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan smiled. \"What a goosey thing to do that would be. Where could we\\r\\n\\n\\nrun to?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"To Mrs. Roberts; she would take us in and make us have an awfully good\\r\\n\\n\\ntime.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe idea of running all the way from Boston to California was too much\\r\\n\\n\\nfor Nan, and she laughed outright. Then suddenly she faced the future\\r\\n\\n\\nbravely; it was her part to bolster up these younger sisters of hers,\\r\\n\\n\\nand she would do it if possible. \"Oh, we\\'ll make the best of it,\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid. \"No doubt we shall have awfully good times even if they do feed\\r\\n\\n\\nus on baked-beans and cod-fish. We shall have lots of snow so we can go\\r\\n\\n\\ncoasting, and skating and perhaps we shall have some sleigh-rides. Then\\r\\n\\n\\nthere\\'ll be Saturdays, you know, when we can go to see Charlotte. Who\\r\\n\\n\\ncan tell what good times are ahead, anyway? Sometimes the very meanest\\r\\n\\n\\nprospects turn out finely. Look at your being stuck in the elevator,\\r\\n\\n\\nfor instance; see what it has brought about.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What are you talking about over there?\" said Mr. Pinckney from the\\r\\n\\n\\nother side of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I was just telling Jack that nobody knows what good a day may bring\\r\\n\\n\\nforth,\" said Nan in unconscious imitation of her Aunt Sarah Dent.\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Just think of it, a year ago we didn\\'t even know you all. We all were\\r\\n\\n\\nsnoozing away in Virginia and you never dreamed of there being four\\r\\n\\n\\nCorners in the world. Then because Jack stuck in the elevator we\\r\\n\\n\\nstayed over in New Orleans, and because we stayed over we went to the\\r\\n\\n\\ncandy shop and there we got acquainted with you, Mr. St. Nick. Then,\\r\\n\\n\\nbecause Aunt Helen dropped her handkerchief she found the señorita--I\\r\\n\\n\\nbeg your pardon, I mustn\\'t say that any more; she\\'s always to be Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nDolores to us. So things just happen all the time without our planning\\r\\n\\n\\nand who knows what lovely things are ahead of us.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s my little philosopher,\" said Mr. Pinckney approvingly. \"It was\\r\\n\\n\\na happy accident that threw you all in my way, indeed; but for that I\\r\\n\\n\\nshould probably never have known my granddaughter.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Mail for Miss Dolores Garcia,\" said Carter coming in with a letter in\\r\\n\\n\\nhis hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Pinckney, sir, not Garcia,\" corrected Mr. Pinckney.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Of course. I beg pardon, Miss G-Pinckney. Oh, bother, I\\'ll say Miss\\r\\n\\n\\nDolores and then I\\'ll make no mistake.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It is from my uncle,\" remarked Miss Dolores. \"I will read it if you\\r\\n\\n\\nall will excuse.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nShe took the letter to the window and ran over its contents. \"It is\\r\\n\\n\\njust as you already know,\" she said at last. \"I am truly Dolores\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney. My uncle acknowledges that it is my right name and he is\\r\\n\\n\\nvery glad that I have found out without his having broken his oath.\\r\\n\\n\\nHe is pleased that I have found so kind and good a relative as this\\r\\n\\n\\ndear grandfather. He sends greetings to, you, sir.\" She bowed slightly\\r\\n\\n\\nto Mr. Pinckney, \"and to all the friends who have been so kind to\\r\\n\\n\\nme,\" again that little foreign manner of bowing. \"He is a good man,\\r\\n\\n\\nthat poor uncle,\" she went on, \"and he is happy for me. Now, my dear\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather, I belong to you and to my dear aunt. _Beso a ustedes la\\r\\n\\n\\nmono, señor y señora_,\" she said with a little laugh and dropping a\\r\\n\\n\\npretty curtsey.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I never doubted for one moment that you belonged to us,\" returned Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney, \"but I am glad, for your sake, that you have this further\\r\\n\\n\\ntestimony. Now, then, good people, all, when do we start? Ho, for the\\r\\n\\n\\nYellowstone! Will you go with us, Jennie?\" he asked his daughter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"No, thank you, father,\" she replied. \"I\\'ve seen the Yellowstone, you', metadata={'source': 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/71353/71353-0.txt'}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Yellowstone!

I will not promise, but I will try to come.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d better,\" remarked Mr. Pinckney. \"We must have a family party,\\r\\n\\n\\nand it wouldn\\'t be complete without my daughter. And you, Mr. Carter\\r\\n\\n\\nBarnwell, how about you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not in it, sir. You know I\\'m an exile and shouldn\\'t dare to risk a\\r\\n\\n\\nNew York blizzard.\" He spoke lightly, but he looked grave. \"I can tell\\r\\n\\n\\nyou,\" he added, \"it breaks a fellow up to have all this cutting out of\\r\\n\\n\\nthe best part of the crowd. Can\\'t you adopt me as a sort of nephew,\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Roberts? I don\\'t know what I shall do when all the others leave.\\r\\n\\n\\nCouldn\\'t you give me a horse stall in your stable or somehow let me\\r\\n\\n\\nhang on to you?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, Mrs. Bobs,\" cried Jack, possessing herself of Carter\\'s hand, \"you\\r\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t know how nice and jolly and kind Carter is. Won\\'t you let him\\r\\n\\n\\ncome live with you when we are gone? He\\'ll be so awfully lonely away\\r\\n\\n\\nfrom his mother and all of us.\" Jack was really concerned for the\\r\\n\\n\\nwelfare of this comrade of hers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMrs. Roberts\\'s kind eyes rested compassionately upon the lad. \"Would\\r\\n\\n\\nyou really like to come to us?\" she said.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Would you take in a \\'no-count\\' boarder like myself?\" he asked,\\r\\n\\n\\neagerly. \"I\\'ll take you out in my car, if you like, and when Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nRoberts must be away I\\'ll play protector, and I\\'ll even go down town\\r\\n\\n\\nand match worsteds for you. Now that you have a niece, don\\'t you want a\\r\\n\\n\\nnephew?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"What do you say, Ben?\" said Mrs. Roberts, turning to her husband.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s just as you say, my dear. For my own part I should like nothing\\r\\n\\n\\nbetter than young life about the house.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Then, Carter, your Aunt Jennie will take you in and mother you to the\\r\\n\\n\\nbest of her ability,\" Mrs. Roberts told the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nFor answer Carter bent and kissed her hand with an old-fashioned\\r\\n\\n\\ngallantry. There were actual tears in his eyes when he lifted his head\\r\\n\\n\\nand it seemed that he could not speak his thanks except to say: \"You\\r\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t know what that means to me.\" Then he walked away to the window\\r\\n\\n\\nand no one followed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen drew her chair closer to Mrs. Roberts. \"My dear,\" she said,\\r\\n\\n\\n\"you\\'ve done a real deed of charity for which his mother will bless\\r\\n\\n\\nyou. That is a real mother boy, and no one knows better than I how he\\r\\n\\n\\nmisses his home. I don\\'t believe you will ever regret befriending him.\"\\r\\n\\n\\nAnd Mrs. Roberts never did.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIn another day the trunks were all packed, the boxes to be sent home\\r\\n\\n\\ndirect had been started on their way, and California would soon be\\r\\n\\n\\na place only of remembrance to the Corners. Falling in with Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney\\'s plans they had decided to return east by Yellowstone Park\\r\\n\\n\\nand the Great Lakes rather than to take a route carrying them further\\r\\n\\n\\nnorth. \"Let the young folks see the Yellowstone and Niagara,\" said Mr.\\r\\n\\n\\nPinckney; \"they will be worth more to them than any other places we\\r\\n\\n\\ncould strike on our way back, for then they will have seen two of the\\r\\n\\n\\ngreatest wonders of their own country and will be ready for Europe when\\r\\n\\n\\nyou want to take them.

The future\\r\\n\\n\\nheld home, love, protection, and freedom from galling poverty, a doting\\r\\n\\n\\ngrandfather to lavish gifts upon her and to turn to in difficulties.\\r\\n\\n\\nWhat more could she ask? On her part she was all woman, and had begun\\r\\n\\n\\nalready to exercise a pretty solicitude for him which pleased him\\r\\n\\n\\nmightily and which promised well for the days when he should need a\\r\\n\\n\\nministering hand.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan looking at her one day as she was hovering over her grandfather\\r\\n\\n\\nsaid: \"And so the princess came into her own and lived in great state\\r\\n\\n\\never after at the castle.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nMiss Helen nodded understandingly. \"Until----\" she suggested a\\r\\n\\n\\ncontinuation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan took up the tale: \"Until a prince came that way and asked her hand\\r\\n\\n\\nin marriage. This would not the old king bestow until the prince had\\r\\n\\n\\npromised three things; one was that he should become as his own son and\\r\\n\\n\\nlive in the castle; the second was that he should prove his manhood by\\r\\n\\n\\nsome knightly deed; the third one--what was the third, Aunt Helen?\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"The third was that he should show himself able to support a wife\\r\\n\\n\\nwithout aid of the treasure in the king\\'s coffers and that he must be a\\r\\n\\n\\nknight par excellence, of good name, stainless reputation, and educated\\r\\n\\n\\nin those things which do make a gentle knight ready to hold his own in\\r\\n\\n\\nkings\\' courts.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Lovely,\" said Nan; then after a pause, \"I hope the prince will not\\r\\n\\n\\ncome too soon for the sake of our dear old St. Nick. Aunt Helen, I\\r\\n\\n\\nwonder if the next year will be as full as this. If it is and exciting\\r\\n\\n\\nthings pile up this way year after year, I shall not be able to stand\\r\\n\\n\\nit at all by the time I am thirty or forty.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t give yourself any uneasiness,\" replied Miss Helen; \"the quiet\\r\\n\\n\\ndays will come and you will be glad that memory holds so much in store\\r\\n\\n\\nfor you to live on in days of famine.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nNan nodded. She and her Aunt Helen often had this sort of talk and it\\r\\n\\n\\nwas dear to Nan\\'s heart. \"What shall I do without you next winter?\" she\\r\\n\\n\\nsighed. \"That will be a time of famine, for I shall be starving for you\\r\\n\\n\\nand mother.\"\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\"You will have new influences, my dear, that will fill your life and\\r\\n\\n\\ngive you new inspiration.

            "summary: The story of Little Women begins in the home of the March family. The four March daughters Meg, Jo, Beth, and the youngest Amy are gathered together in the living room. They are discussing the upcoming Christmas along with their Mother who is upstairs collecting clothes for the family. As the clock strikes six, the girls each pick out a pair of slippers to give to their poor friend Marmee while her husband is away. They then discuss what they will buy for themselves for Christmas and decide to do so rather than spend money on presents for their mother. After the girls have finished their shopping, they all prepare for Christmas breakfast where they will give bread and milk to their neighbor, the Hummel family. Their mother comes home later in the day and reads the girls a letter from their father who is serving in the war. He writes that he will be away from home for at least another year and that they should all work hard so that while he is gone they may all be loving children and doing their duty. The girls agree to do their duty and begin reading their books every morning before they go to bed. Throughout the novel, the hardships endured by the family are depicted through the hardships of trying to be good and the difficulties that come with trying to overcome those burdens. In addition to describing the struggles of being good, the book also gives the readers a guidebook for navigating the path to peace which will lead them to the Celestial City. Chapters One and Two Little Women opens with\n",
            "The girls put on a play for Marmee, and she is very touched by the gifts they give her. The rest of the day is spent in preparation for the evening performance of their play. They do not have much money, so they make do with what they have. On Christmas night, they perform their play, in which Jo gets to play male roles. During intermission, they discuss how they will get ready for the New Year's Eve dance they are to have at the home of Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, and Laurie. Meg has a crush on Laurie, and Jo hopes he will rescue her from the evil step-mother of her step-brother, Theodore Laurence. In Chapter Three, the audience learns about the elaborate preparations for the party and the two actors rehearse their parts. Jo overhears Meg telling Jo that she has sprained her ankle after one of Meg's shoes turned up in her path. To help her, Jo asks a servant if she can borrow his carriage. At the end of the first half of the play, Jo receives an invitation to the New Years Eve party from Mrs. March's sister, where she and Meg are to be the only guests. Jo and Meg decide to accept the invitation despite Meg's reluctance because she wants to go to the party as often as she can. While getting ready for bed, Jo accidentally burns Meg's hair while trying to curl it, but promises to straighten it later. She also\n",
            "A few days after the New Year's party, Meg and Jo return home from the party, where Hannah offers to drive them back in a carriage in case it rains. They take the carriage because it is on her way home and Hannah agrees to pick them up later in the day when it is less likely to rain. Meg tells Jo that she had a good time, until she hurt herself dancing with a redheaded man. When they return home, the girls tell their stories to their sisters, who are eager to hear all about the party. After Mr. March loses his property trying to help a friend, the two eldest Marches girls decide to earn their own way back to financial stability. Meg takes a job as a nursery governess, but finds it harder than she thought it would be because she has to do all of the child-rearing chores that most young ladies do not have to do. Jo decides to take over the care of Aunt March, for whom she has a special affection. Beth does not do well in school because she is too shy, so she stays at home and helps Hannah around the house. Amy loves music, but wishes she could learn to play the piano. She is vain and vain about her nose, which is flat and constantly pinches. She also has a talent for drawing and making things out of cardboard cutouts. The Laurence family has many servants, but none of them are very rich. In fact, according to Jo,\n",
            "Laurie settles in to have a little chat with Jo, who has brightened up the room with her chatter. They talk about all the things they like to do and make each other laugh, and then Laurie asks Jo to read aloud from some of the books she has brought. She tells him stories about Mrs. March and her friends, and he is very glad to hear that Beth is such a good reader. Jo tries to show off her cleverness for Laurie, but Laurie is not interested in any of it. He just wants to talk about the cats. As Jo continues to talk, the conversation turns to Mr. Lawrence, whom Jo calls \"my grandfather\" or \"the old gentleman.\" The old gentleman sends over a pair of his slippers, which Jo does not know how to properly thank him for. A few weeks later, after a visit from the Lawrence, Jo gets a thank you note from him. In return, he sends her a gift: a miniature piano that belonged to the granddaughter of his deceased friend. Over the next several weeks, the Laurences entertain the March girls and their friends at their house. Laurie also plays the piano for Jo, much to her delight, and she is so enamored of it that she decides to learn to play it as well as Laurie does. At the end of the day, she goes to tell her family about the wonderful music being played in the house, and they are all enchanted by it.\n",
            "Amy's Valley of Humiliation Amy sighs for money, wishing she had a little of the money that Laurie spends on his horse. She tells her sisters that she is in debt and cannot pay her limes until she has money. To get money, she sells them at school and trades them off for pencils and other trinkets. Marmee forbids her to sell them at the shop, so Amy uses the money she earns from selling the limes to buy groceries. The next day, Amy was to go to the school with Laurie, but she runs into trouble when she tries to borrow money from him. He throws her out of his class. At recess, Amy goes home and begs her sisters for forgiveness, but they do not believe her. They also refuse to let her go skating with Laurie as she had promised. Finally, she asks Laurie to take her, but just as they are about to throw her onto the ice, Amy falls through the ice and is trapped. Jo sees Amy and rushes to her side, but does not tell her which direction to turn. Amy turns around and is hit by a log, and Jo does not realize what has happened until Amy cries out. They have to rescue Amy and get her home safely. When Mrs. March tells Jo that Amy is safe, Jo admits that she would have felt terrible if Amy had died. She blames her bad temper on the fact that she often loses patience with her sisters and their needs.\n",
            "The chapter opens with Marmee admonishing Jo to master her quick temper, which she has learned from her Heavenly Father. She tells Jo that talking about Father reminded her how much she misses him and how faithfully she should watch over her two daughters. Jo asks if it was wrong of her to tell Mother about the incident at the Moffat's, and Mother says that it was not, and that she feels safe and happy here with her girls. She goes on to explain that the troubles and tribulations of her earthly life are beginning but can be overcome if Jo learns to feel the tenderness of her heavenly father as she does with her earthly one. In this way, she says, the Heavenly Father will become a source of peace, happiness and strength. The next few scenes focus on the preparations for a small party at which Meg, Amy, Jo, Beth, and the Moffats are all invited. On the first night, Meg is dressed up in her finest attire and ready to rock the party. As she waits for her dance partner, she overhears some of the girls discussing what they think of her dress. They make fun of her for being dressed up like a fashion plate and call her \"a little beauty,\" calling her accessories \"dowdy taratas,\" and commenting on her cuteness. Meg tries to act the part of a fashionable lady, but ends up acting like a poor man's daughter instead. Laurie shows up at the party wearing his best\n",
            "Mrs. March tells Meg and Jo that they should never repeat the \"foolish gossip\" about Laurie, and both girls promise to forget it. Marmee says that she hopes that her daughters will be the \"pride and comfort of our lives,\" and encourages them to learn to value praise and adorn themselves with modesty as well as beauty. In the spring, the girls take to gardening and form a secret society called the Pickwick Club, where they meet once a week to discuss club matters and read a newspaper each week. However, the days grow longer and more uneventful, and on Saturday morning they discover that there is no fire in their kitchen, no breakfast, and their mother is not at home. Mrs. March takes a holiday, and the girls get to enjoy the benefits of the play-system without their mother's interference. After several days of this kind of unrestrained fun, the experiment ends when a priest appears and asks the girls to kneel before him. He explains that he has come to perform the marriage of his daughter, and none of the girls remove their masks. The narrator gives a long description of the elaborate masquerade ball that takes place in the high-class rooms of Count Adelon and his entourage. At the end of the masquerade, Laurie presents the club with a guest, who turns out to be...Sam Weller! Jo, Beth, Amy, and Amy all vote Sam Weller into joining the club\n",
            "The next morning, Jo decides to throw a dinner party for Laurie. Meg tells her that she will take a vacation from housekeeping because she does not know how to cook. Jo, trusting her own abilities as a cook, orders a large quantity of food and sets out the table. In the confusion that ensues, the party is spoiled when one of the girls drops a canary in the box of food she has made for the bird. Beth cries over the bird, whom she has named Pip because she has forgotten to feed him. Jo comforts her and prepares for the day's activities, which include a picnic and a game of croquet. During the picnic, the croquet game degenerates into a quarrel between Jo and Fred, who has accidentally hit a croquet ball with his mallet while attempting to pass it to Jo. The rest of the group consists of Meg, Jo, Amy, Beth, Laurie, and Mr. Brooke. At the end of the day, they discover that little Pip has died. They bury him in the yard by the family vault. That evening, they have a party for their English friends, the Vaughns. For the party, Jo serves them a meal of roast beef, potatoes, carrots, applesauce, salad, and pickled cucumbers. Afterward, they all go off to play a game called \"Rig-marole,\" which is a variation on the traditional board game known as \"Rug-mar\n",
            "Meg takes over the narration as she describes the happenings at the castle with her sisters. While narrating, she says that the tyrannical Count Gustave is about to throw the tyrant out a window when he receives a blow from an old man in a Greek lexicon. The old man throws him out, but the tyrant falls into the castle moat. He finds a ladder, uses it to climb down, and lands headfirst in the moat sixty feet below. He then finds a pair of stone steps, covered with dust, spiders, and toads. On reaching the top of the steps, he sees a tall figure all in white wearing a veil. It beckons him down a corridor of dark and cold empty rooms with ghostly effigies. The specter plucks him back and waves threateningly before him. Snuffbox. Jo explains that the ghost picked up the victim and placed him in a box, where eleven other knuckles are packed inside. They dance a hornpipe tune as they return to the castle. The captain of the Portuguese pirate ship meets them on the ramp, and the British captain declares victory for his crew. The pirates have a rowdy game of pick-up and drop-and-go, which involves lots of silly wordplay. Ned tries to get the cat to chase after the mouse, but fails miserably. Amy pretends to read aloud from a book while the rest of the girls play a game of truth\n",
            "Laurie has the key to his castle, but isn't allowed to use it. The girls argue over whether or not any of them will ever be able to fulfill their wishes. Laurie chews grass and thinks about college, while Jo wonders how many of them have fulfilled their wishes and if they will meet ten years from now to see how close they are to achieving their dreams. Meg ponders what she will be when she is twenty-seven, and Jo wonders what her life will be like by that time. Laurie talks about his grandfather trying to get him to be a merchant in India, and says that going to college should satisfy him, but he plans to do it as his father did. Jo advises Laurie to sail away on one of his own ships and never come back home again until he fulfills his wish. Laurie agrees, but Jo tells him to wait until it brings him something worth having. In the meantime, all of the girls work on getting ready for college. Jo writes a manuscript and then another one, and sends them out to find people to deliver them. A few minutes later, Jo receives a telegram telling her that Mr. March is very ill and that she needs to go to the doctor immediately. For several minutes, the girls gather in the parlor and listen to the sounds of people arriving at the doctor's office. Jo pretends to read the telegram aloud so that everyone can hear, and then reads it. She learns that\n",
            "Laurie hears of Marmee's illness and decides to come at once to be with her. He offers himself as a go-between for Mrs. March and her husband, and when she refuses, he offers to travel with her to Washington, D. C. in her place. The girls are touched by his concern, but they soon forget all about him. Jo has earned twenty-five dollars by selling her hair, and the family is overjoyed to hear of Mr. Brooke's offer to accompany her on her trip. That night, Marmece leaves to see Mr. Brook, and before she can leave, Jo cries a little, thinking of her lost hair. In the morning, the girls prepare for their mother's departure, Meg sews, Jo plays the piano, Beth sings, Amy does needlework, and Hannah irons. Beth goes to Mother's room to wait for her, and later that afternoon, Jo finds Beth sitting alone in the medicine closet with a bottle of medicine in her hand holding a red ribbon. Beth explains that the bottle was hers, not hers alone; she tried to warm it with her feet, but it did not take, so she prayed for it by herself. Jo tries to comfort Beth, but Beth begins to cry. After a week of hard work, the family relaxes its vigilance and everyone falls back into familiar routines. Jo catches a cold through neglect of her task of caring for the household chores,\n",
            "The scarlet fever epidemic worsens, and Amy contracts the disease first at Aunt March's and then at her mother's house. Laurie tries to nurse her back to health while Jo nurses Meg, but both girls are struck with fear that they may also contract the disease. Beth is particularly susceptible and is in danger of contracting the illness if she does not leave home immediately. Marmee sends Amy off to live with Aunt March for a spell to keep her away from dangerous places, while Jo stays behind at home to nurse Beth. During this time, Aunt March becomes increasingly cruel to Amy, forcing her to do housework, sewing, reading aloud, and playing with her parrot, Mop. The only good thing about this situation is the kindness of Laurie and the maid, Esther, who takes an interest in Amy even though she dislikes Amy's attitude toward her. Throughout this period of time, Amy is very ill and close to death. Finally, Laurie breaks the news to Jo that he has sent a telegram to Mrs. March asking her to come home. When she arrives home, Beth is much improved, but still very sickly. Around midnight, however, the fever breaks and Beth revives. Mother is expected home any minute.\n",
            "Esther March offers to help Amy set up a little shrine for her in the chapel at the March house. She also tells Amy to pray for her sister and sends over some jewelry that Aunt March has given her. Amy is very earnest about this, and spends all her time thinking of God and praying for Beth. One day, Esther sets up a light closet next to Amy's bed so that she can have some place to put her jewelry after Aunt March dies. Amy decides to try on the ring that will become her engagement ring when she marries Laurie. The ring turns out to be a very valuable gift from Aunt March, but Amy borrows it because she knows Aunt March would never give it to her. From then on, Amy tries hard to live up to her reputation as a good girl and behaves with propriety and respect. She practices her religious beliefs and follows the rules set out for her by Aunt March. Amy gives away most of her possessions to other members of the family, including her doll collection, her Bible, her clothes, and her sketchbook. Jo gets a letter from Mr. Brooke, but Meg gets one from Laurie. Both girls realize that there is something amiss in the letter, but they cannot figure out what it is until Jo confesses that she doesn't know either of them had written it. They soon get involved in a game of hide-and-seek, which involves them trying to guess what the person who wrote the note was\n",
            "Laurie is summoned to the Marches' home. When he enters, he gives an earnest apology and pleads for Meg and Jo's forgiveness. The girls forgive him and send him on his way. Jo and Meg then decide to have a little party to celebrate Christmas. They plan to surprise Mr. March and run away with him. Laurie objects, but Jo convinces him that it is a good idea. During the party, Jo pretends to be outraged at Laurie's behavior, but secretly feels sorry for him. After the party is over, the family examines all of the presents that Laurie has given them. Jo finds a note addressed to \"Mrs. John Brooke,\" which she promptly throws into the fire. In the next few weeks, Beth continues to slowly improve. She is now able to move around the house and play with the cats. As Christmas approaches, Jo and Laurie come up with many elaborate plans to celebrate the holiday. They finally reveal their plan when they give the girls a snow sculpture that they have made. Beth is very happy with the gift. Over the next several weeks, everything runs smoothly.\n",
            "Meg decides to tell Mr. Brooke that she is too young to be engaged, and asks Jo to be her confidant in case he should propose. Meg goes on to explain that she has planned out what she would say if he did propose and that she would reject him out of respect for her own independence and sense of propriety. Jo teases her, saying that she thought Meg was going to tell the man to leave her alone, but Meg says no. Instead, she plans to tell him that she accepts his proposal but would like to remain friends as they were when they were just friends. As Meg finishes her speech, she is interrupted by a visit from Aunt March, who wants to know if Meg intends to accept Mr. Brook-her father's friend, Mr. Poins. When Meg explains that she does not yet feel ready to talk about marriage, Aunt March scoffs at Meg, calling her \"a whole lot of trouble\" and tells her that she ought to marry whom she pleases. She then launches into a long lecture on the folly of trying to marry someone you do not love. In the course of the lecture, Meg defends John Brooke against Aunt March's scolding, and the two sisters fight over who gets to pick the flowers for the bridal bouquet. The war has ended, and peace has returned to the March household. Meg has spent the last three years preparing for her wedding. Mr. March has returned home after serving in the\n",

Aunt March made a great deal of trouble to hide the fact that she was going to give money to Meg if she married \"that Brooke,\" but she finally came up with a plan that worked. The whole family got together and they decided to have a little party to celebrate Meg and John's upcoming marriage. All of the girls got into the spirit of things, and Amy, Jo, Beth, and Meg all put on their best performances. There was lots of good fun. Meg made her own wedding dress, borrowed from a friend, and had all of her sisters help her make it. After the wedding, everyone gathered in the living room for a reception reception with food and music. It was very much like any other party we might have seen today, except that instead of serving alcohol, they served cake. Laurie tried to serve the bride, but accidentally spilled the wine on the floor. Everyone cleared up as soon as it was safe to do so. Then there was a round of games of make-believe where people would pretend to be dead or alive, which Amy won every time. Finally, Meg walked out onto the stage and said her vows, and everyone watched her walk down to the altar. And that was the end of the play. The story of\n",
            "The next day, Amy decides to throw a party for her and Meg. Marmee graciously consents to the plan, but Jo objects because she does not want to participate. The party ends up costing more than planned, and much of the food and preparations are made by hand. When the party is ready to go, it is rained out, and the guests do not arrive. The next morning, fearing the worst, Jo runs out to get a lobster, as she usually does, but finds that she has forgotten to bring any salad. To cheer herself up, she tells herself that she will make a good impression on everyone with her new skill at running a household. She dresses up in fancy clothes and takes a traveling basket filled with delicacies to the party. At the door of the house, she meets Miss Eliott, who agrees to lend her the basket. Unfortunately, the basket turns out to be filled with miscellaneous odds and ends. During the party, Jo amuses herself by pretending to write a sensationalist story and then reads it to the whole family. Everyone likes it, but Mr. March scolds her for leaving out too many of the important details, and they debate whether or not she should have left out the word \"love.\" After the party ends, Jo goes home and writes another story, this time with a twist: instead of calling it a sensation story, she calls it a thriller. It is well received, and Jo receives\n",

She tells him what happened and he asks what is wrong until she tells him that she has just brought home a guest, Jack Scott. Meg castes him off when she sees that he laughs at her and tells him to throw the jelly out the window. She complains about how he shouldn't have been so busy all morning and should have known better than to think of inviting a guest over when she was so busy. John defends himself by saying that he had no time to cook dinner, and Meg resents his weak-willedness. During the evening conversation, Meg and Amy get into an argument about Meg's tendency to be overly garrulous and show off her cleverness in front of others. In the discussion, they each try to give the other person their best impression, and Amy gives Jo advice on how to behave in public. After the dinner, Meg goes to tell Mrs. March and Mr. Brooke, but John does not come. The next day, Meg has Mr. Moffat over for a visit, and during the visit she shows off her new baby twins, whom she has named Demi and Daisy. At the same time, Amy and Jo are getting ready for a trip to the Chesters' party. As they prepare for the party, Jo decides to make a call on behalf of the family, which surprises Amy\n",
            "The art fair that is to be held at the Chesters' house turns out to be a bust. The aunts, Amy and Jo are there, as are several other young ladies from the neighborhood, and the conversation devolves into tales of Amy's adventures in fashion, singing, story telling, card games, and flower arranging. Most of the women are sympathetic to Amy, but some are jealous of her because of her favored status with the rich Mr.Chester. May Chester is especially jealous of Amy, who has sold all of her artwork to help fund the fair. Jo defends Amy, however, by pointing out that many of the rich people at the fair have more money than she does. The next morning, Amy tries to win the good graces of the ladies by serving them food and flowers, but soon finds that they do not appreciate her efforts. She also has to contend with the nastiness of her own family when her older sister, whom she dislikes as much as she does her sister, criticizes her for being too influenced by fashionable men. After the fair ends, Amy tells her younger sister that she would like to become a Mission: Impossible: Impossibleist, but without the special sauce of being able to communicate with aliens.\n",

When Amy gets home from the fair, she finds the vases filled with flowers that May has bought for her, as a reward for her kindness. Aunt Carrol hears about the success of the fair and says something to Mrs. Marlor about it, which makes the older lady beam with pride. A week later, Jo gets her reward in the form of a letter from Aunt Carrother asking her to accompany Amy on a trip to Europe. Jo is very disappointed, although she tries to be cheerful about it: she does not want to spoil Amy's happiness. Beth comforts her by saying that she is glad Jo is not going because she cannot be as selfish as she would like to be. Jo sends a letter to Marmee telling her what has happened with regard to the trip. She and Jo write letters back and forth between each other describing the various places they have visited and the people they have met along the way. They have gone to Queenstown, Ireland, where Mr. March lives, and also to London, where they will be staying for a week. In one letter, Amy tells Jo that she thinks Fred may propose to her, and if he does, she will accept. Amy explains that she likes him well enough that she would be willing to marry him, even though he is not her model hero. The next week they are traveling through Germany and Switzerland\n",

She hates \"philandering\" and will not allow it. However, when Laurie ceases to worship at shrines, she begins to notice signs of his feelings for her. On a quiet day at the school, Jo receives a visit from a woman named Miss Norton who shows her some of her treasures and asks Jo to accompany her as her escort to lectures and concert if she likes. When Jo returns to the nursery, she finds Beth and Laurie playing together and playing games, and she sees that Beth is very quiet and very sweet to Laurie. Jo thinks that something wonderful has happened between them and suggests that they should get married. The next day Jo goes to see Mrs. March about getting ready for a trip to New York. That evening, Laurie and Jo discuss flirting and flirtation, and decide that Jo should leave for a time so that Laurie does not get too attached. They also decide that Laurie should pursue a romance with one of the modest girls in the church choir. Later that night, Jo hears a sobbing at Beth's bedside and rushes to her side.

The den turned out to be a mess of books, papers, toys, and trinkets belonging to various children which were strewn all over the place. Jo tried to salvage some of the things but ended up with most of them being burned or thrown away. Jo took it as a good sign, however, and decided to mend some of his things for him so that he would stop giving them away. A few days later, Jo went to a meeting of a bunch of authors and heard one of their talks on how to write fiction. After listening to this, Jo decided to start writing stories for them. She dressed up as a kiddie story-teller and told them stories they could read in order to get them to likeable. They liked her so much that she agreed to do more of this kind of writing for them as well.

Then she tries child's stories, which do not sell well, and finally she tries a romance novel that does not find a buyer. Jo also stops writing about her relationship with Laurie, who has graduated from college. In the spring, Jo realizes that she loves Laurie more than she ever thought she could love him. She tells him so, and he responds by saying that he loves her too, but that he can't tell her how he feels because she never lets him in on the secret. They talk about their different ways of expressing their love for one another, and Laurie says that he would run away with Jo if she would let him.

Finally, one day, Beth tells her that she understands and isn't upset about it, just like she said she would. She tries to explain that she gave up hope in the fall, when she saw how close to despair Beth was and didn't want to be a part of it.

He misses the domestic attentions she used to give him, but resigns himself to living without his wife for a while. During this time, John Scott finds himself neglecting his housework and feels like a stranger at home. Marmee has married and gone to housekeeping, so he spends evenings running over to see her rather than sitting in the parlor by himself. Meg is happy at first, but as the babies take over more of her attention, she begins to miss him.

This upsets Demi greatly, and exhausts Meg, who wants to kiss him good night. The next day, John comes home to find Demi behaving\n",
            "Laurie seems to have a new, bitter look on his face, and Amy recognizes that something is wrong. She asks him when he plans to reveal his secret, but he says it isn't time yet. He also tells her that he doesn't plan to tell secrets from home, which relieves her of some of the anxiety she had been feeling. Laurie then asks Amy if she intends to do something splendid for Jo, or make her love him. Amy says she doesn't intend to be a great artist, but would rather be a good person. The next time Laurie finds himself in a mood of \"passionate and moody\" mood, Amy goes to Vienna with some musical friends and begins to work on a requiem for Jo. When Fred Vaughn comes up, Amy tries to flirt with him, but Laurie rejects her advances as unrequited. Later, Amy gives Laurie a lecture on being a good man, which he does not take well. At the end of the lecture, both Amy and Laurie express their dislike for one another. As they part, Amy resolves to deliver her talk without delay. In the course of the conversation, Amy admits to Laurie that she dislikes him, and he responds by admitting that he didn't mean it that way. They each try to act as if the other hadn't meant it, and Laurie confesses to Amy that he hates Miss Randal. A few days later, Beth dies. Jo sleeps on a couch\n",
            "Laurie tries to compose a requiem but finds that he is unable to complete it, and then an opera is the only thing that comes to mind. He also tries to write a love song for Jo, but his memory fails him, as it only shows her in her usual disreputable aspects. Finally, he gives up on the Requiem and tries an opera. Again, he has no success. Next, he tries writing a romance. After attending an opera, he realizes that everyone who loves music is not a composer; he tears up his sheets of music and realizes that his talent is not genius. Then he begins to look for work. Laurie sells his art and goes off to Paris. In the meantime, he writes to Amy frequently, hoping that she will come to visit him. When she does, he puts the ring on his finger and takes it off, leaving it in a drawer. She replies soon after, confessing that she is homesick and wants to see him. They write long letters back and forth. Fred Vaughn returns and asks Amy to marry him, but she says no. The narrator tells us that Amy and Laurie's correspondence continues through the spring and into the summer. Laurie travels to Vevay to be near Amy, and they spend much time together. Amy admires Laurie, and he shows her how to be a dutiful brother to her parents and sister to her little brother. As Amy grows more attached to him,\n",
            "The chapter opens with a conversation between Marmee and Jo in which she explains that she is not as scatterbrained as she was before but is much more mature and sensible. She apologizes for being so selfish when she refused Teddy's love after the first time they met, and admits that she would feel less selfish if he came back to her now if he asked. Marmees reply is that it is good that she has gotten on with her life and that she should be content with family and friends until the \"best lover of all\" comes along and picks her up again. Jo then goes on to talk about Laurie, explaining that she finds him just as beautiful as Laurie does, and that loving him makes her happy. Jo compares herself to an old spinster, thinking about all the things she used to do and all the people who helped her. She thinks about how fast time has gone by, realizing that tomorrow will be her twenty-fiveth birthday. Suddenly, Laurie appears at the door. He tells Jo that he and Amy are married and have come to spend their honeymoon in Paris. They had planned to come home earlier, but when Grandfather changed his mind, they decided to spend the winter in Paris instead. When they arrived, however, they found that there was no way to escape the clutches of Amy's family, so they went to stay with Amy's mother. As Jo watches them together, she sees that Amy has grown into a\n",
            "The Laurences have a ball, but it does not go as planned. They sit around the fire talking and singing until Meg gets up to go to bed. Then they decide to have their sing-a-long in the old fashioned way. Beth is still with them, and her presence is visible even more than before. Laurie encourages Amy to play the piano, but Amy says she cannot tonight. Jo sings Beth's songs with such tenderness that the listener feels as though Beth is watching over her. Finally, they finish with Monsieur Bhaer singing his German song. The Professor leaves, and Laurie invites him to come back, saying that there will always be a welcome home for him. The next day Laurie comes over to ask Marmee if he can borrow Mrs. March's wife for a half hour so he can go through her daughters' Paris finery. In the course of the conversation, it becomes clear that everyone at the table knows exactly what is going on between Jo and the Professor. After a few days, the Professor begins to come regularly to the house when Jo is out running errands, and people begin to suspect that he is in love with her. Jo continues to deny it, but secretly hopes that the Professor will propose to her someday. In Chapter Forty Five, Jo walks to Meg's house and meets the Professor on the way. She asks Meg if she would like to run an errand and offers to bring him coffee for him\n",
            "Jo races across the street in the rain to do some last-minute shopping and bumps into an old man who kindly gives her a handkerchief to use as a bonnet. In the confusion of hurried action, she bumps into Professor Bhaer whose umbrella she doesn't notice until she sees it bobbing above her head. He tells her that he's been looking for her and offers to take her shopping. She thanks him and they begin walking arm-in-arm through the wet. The professor asks if she's going to say goodbye to her family, and she says no. They banter back and forth about whether or not Jo is going to succeed in her business, and then the professor tells her he's found a place for her to teach at a college where she can earn enough money to pay for her own way. As they leave the store, the professor tries on many different dresses, shawls, and bouquets before settling on a gray shawl with delicate daisies. When they walk home, the narrator lets us in on their scheme to raise a school for poor and needy boys at Plumfield, Jo's estate. They don't have much money, but they have a knack for finding boys who need the kind of love and attention that only the Bhaers can give. Over time, the school grows into a thriving operation, filled with boys from all walks of life, from gentle to boisterous to belligerent. Mr\n",
            "Five years after Jo's wedding, the family and friends come to Plumfield for the annual apple-picking festival. The Marches, Brookes, Bhaers, and others make a day of it and everyone has a wonderful time. Jo is in her element, as she always is, and has two sons of her own named Rob and Teddy. They grow up to be quite pleasant and lovable little boys. There is also a quadroon who is accepted into the school, although some people predict that he will ruin it. During the festival, all the children are asked to give gifts, and Amy makes a clay model of her baby daughter, whom she loves very much. Everyone sings and plays with the children, and the professor gives speeches and teaches the children how to give well. At the end of the day, there is a final celebration with food and games. Mrs. March has a talk with her daughters, and Jo confesses that her castle is not as complete as she had planned, but she would not change it\n"

As the clock strikes six, the girls each pick out a pair of slippers to give to their poor friend Marmee while her husband is away.
